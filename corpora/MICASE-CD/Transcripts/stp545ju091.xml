			<U WHO="S1"> what what uh as i mentioned in class, it's not for instance the emailing. your participation is, how much you contribute it's not how often it's how much it's the content. it's what you're really contributing to the class as a whole. the same for the emailing it's the qualities it's not the quantity, of, the your, email participation. so if you, uh he will talk about, i if you have any further questions regarding, the technical aspects of it, you can ask now. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> Vara did you read our, did you read our, emails? </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> yeah. yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> oh. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> all of 'em? </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> yeah. and sometimes i'd <OVERLAP> print too. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="SU-f">
				<OVERLAP> yeah she </OVERLAP> responds. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> i remember i like someone, wrote like you're probably gonna delete this who wrote that? </U>
			<U WHO="S12"> me. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> Kelly. i'm sure half of you will delete this before reading it, but i just wanted to say that i (xx yesterday with a tear in my eye) <EVENT WHO="S12" DESC="LAUGH"/> most people watching that movie particularly because, he has so many nonactors, there are so many people who were there. what happened was, during the shooting of the, the movie, people passed and they saw the sign. even though they knew it was, the shooting of a feature film, they hoped that, she would really write the letters and give to them and they would get the chance to mail to their loved ones, so as you probably, may have noticed, some of the people truly looked like they were not actors they were just there, opening their hearts they were just saying it and sending a message hoping that they would send a message to a loved one. and at the opening of the film, she they_ the premiere was at that city. so they went there and the people who had invaded the homes like they mentioned that that had really been invaded, they came to her and said that the mayor still hadn't given them electricity. so she went to him and said how come? you promised me when we were here. so there is a lot of um, participation of, the real people from the region. that's what made the movie special, particularly to Brazilians who knew the behind-the-scenes stories. s- and it was nominated for an Oscar it, didn't win but Life Is Beautiful it's, was a good movie too so. i don't know if um, it's working (well.) in the meantime, we can, this here, one of the question this is from Robert from Kevin. Kevin had asked, <SEG TYPE="READING"> how has the media reached the individuals living in the deepest part of the Amazon? are they beginning to try to modernize every, every part of the country? </SEG> anyone would like to try to answer that...? this is a, question that Kevin asked. <SEG TYPE="READING"> how has the media reached individuals, living in the deepest part of the Amazon? </SEG> remember that we saw the Avon lady etcetera etcetera in that documentary. anyone would have from future, presentations anyone would have, any input or any information? i don't wanna answer if it is something that is part of your presentation. yes Betty? </U>
			<U WHO="S10"> well didn't we, learn in like one of the videos like, um T-V is just universal down there, like everyone has one and it's just like all linked together? and so that's how like, people even in the deepest regions can stay in contact. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> it was part of a government, um campaign it was party of the government, plot or, goals, to unite the country. what they wanted were was to have, every single citizen or as many as possible even in the jungle, to have access to T-V, and that was how they spread their, propaganda. it was during the dictatorship. they worked in partnership with Globo which is considered the fourth, largest T-V network in the world. and, the government wanted to show the P-S-As and, documentaries and, T-V ads etcetera, and even soap operas. they were all part of the, uh government plan, to, introduce information that it would benefit the, um government goals and plans. that's why even in the jungle when they didn't have, electricity the government would provide electricity, and buy even if only one T-V set and put in the center of the square and people would come in the evenings and watch T-V. maybe some of you who've had Kottak's anthropology class have heard about that? i remember someone early in the semester men- me- mentioning anthropology. but um, the T-V had a, very, i- it was, it was part of the government's, um plan, to communicate so brought T-V even to Indian villages etcetera. if you guys, are ready is it working Bruce? <U WHO="S4"> oh yeah. it's <OVERLAP> ready to go </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> you guys </OVERLAP> set to go? </U>
			<U WHO="S4"> yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> okay, so we are ready. do we, do we need to turn off the light? <U WHO="S4">
					<OVERLAP> yeah, i think that'd- </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> i don't </OVERLAP> know </U>
			<U WHO="S3"> i don't know. let's see how it projects. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f">
				<OVERLAP> we should probably shut the light off. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1">
				<OVERLAP> oh good that would be </OVERLAP> (xx) does it- or maybe we can turn off the light but keep the windows open? what do you think? do you wanna try Jessica and see if you can, <OVERLAP> and see how? </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S4">
				<OVERLAP> i think maybe with the </OVERLAP> door open, it'll be okay, with the lights off? </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> i beg your pardon can we see with the lights on? </U>
			<U WHO="S4"> i think if the door was open it will give enough light (xx) </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> okay pull up to see from </U>
			<U WHO="SS"> (xx) </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> try the lights to see uh, please. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-m"> oh wow. </U>

			<EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"/>
			<U WHO="S4"> alright. uh... <EVENT DESC="READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"/> seven thousand four hundred ninety-one kilometers of coastline. a tropical climate. sunshine nearly every day. and the most diverse array of organisms on the planet. Amazon. make Brazil one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Brazilians are friendly, warm and happy people. above all they are free-spirited and resent being told what to do. Brazilians are gregarious, outgoing, and love to be around people. the hot climate allows them to spend a great deal of time outdoors, often just chatting with friends or watching people. this seems like an ideal place. however there is much that is less than ideal happening beneath the surface. the prison and law enforcement systems appear certainly less than ideal. torture happens often, and methods of interrogation are frequently inhumane... two women, Marlie and Rosanna, were tortured and sexually assaulted, by civil police when they were interrogated in connection with a murder. the women were taken to a police station and subjected to two days of torture. when Marlie refused to sign a confession, a police officer slapped her on both ears. another policemen then hit her on the soles of her feet, and palms of her hand with a long strip of rubber, cut from a car tire. the police officers both lowered their trousers and rubbed their penises in the face of Marlie who was handcuffed. the couple says this treatment continued for two days, during which they were not permitted to drink, eat, wash, or have contact with a lawyer. the police allegedly also asked for bribes. when they were finally allowed to wash under a water pipe, it was in the presence of a policeman and male prisoners. when they were finally transferred to the women's prison, staff noted their visible injuries and tried to persuade them to have a medical examination, however they refused. because in order to get to the Forensic Medical Institute, they would have had to travel with a police escort made up of the same police who had tortured them. in a hearing before the judge, the couple alleged ill treatment by the police, but the judge has not taken steps to investigate their allegations of torture, despite the existence of a medical report, and eyewitness testimony to their injuries by prison staff. no action has been taken against the policemen involved either. public prosecutors from the court that oversees prison sentences, discovered a range of instruments in a small bathroom in the ground floor of the prison, known to be used for torture sessions. these included wet towels, which are placed over the victim's head, electrical devices from which bare wires protruded for applying electric shocks, and a metal bar, from which victims are suspended upside down by their ankles and wrists. how could any human treat another in such an inhumane way? what is this all about? law enforcement agents are supposed to serve and protect citizens, not rape, beat, torture, and abuse them. the mindset of an individual who feels it necessary or even justifiable to make another human feel less than human is tragic. torture and beatings are an unnecessary part of life. no man deserves to be treated as subordinate. these practices must stop. </U>
			<EVENT DUR=":04" WHO="SS" DESC="APPLAUSE"/>
			<PAUSE DUR=":14"/>
			<U WHO="S6"> okay um i'm going to talk about the the political, um corruption, that happens in Brazil, and relate it to the, the stor- history, of corruption. <EVENT DESC="READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"/> um, Brazil is the largest nation, in South America, and the third world's most populous democracy. political leaders have always faced challenges in ruling Brazil because of its immense size and population. ever since the conquest corruption has been the norm among politicians. because Brazil has been slower to make political changes than the rest of Latin America, it is harder to find similari- similarities between it, and Spanish America. for example, while the Spanish nations were becoming independent through revolutions, Brazil was being ruled by a Portuguese emperor. also, contrary to the majority of Spanish America, slavery was abolished in the late eighteen hundreds, a hundred years after the rest of Spanish America. this might explain the more prominent gap, between the rich and the poor, as the former black slaves, are a majority population of poor, and the white, rich elite, and politicians, are the minority, of wealthy. through the many political regimes, there seems to be a pr- pattern of wealthy, oligarchy controlling, a nation through corruption. through the corrupt military regime_ though the corrupt military regime is over, the democratic state of Brazil, is the democratic state of Brazil immune to the traditional corruption? many scholars believe that the political system needs to be reformed because the corruption is still a prevalent problem. for instance, politicians, can easily partake in corruption because many of them stay in office, for one or less terms. even if they were to stay in office longer, there are ways to get around scandals. one of the most used methods is through the corrupt judiciary system. though Brazil's constitution imitates the U-S one, there are many inconsistencies. the court system, is supposed to balance the power of the Congress and executive branch. but if all are corrupt, how can the corruption be eliminated? as for the political candidates, how can the people elect a politician, when the campaigns are based on personality and not ability? yes the people have the right to vote, but is there really an honest politician to choose from? many believe that the current President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, is the one to break the chain, of corrupt politicians. however recently a scandal arose, involving him and a Cayman Islands bank account, holding, three hundred and sixty-eight million dollars. luckily the documents claiming this turned out to be false. nevertheless Cardoso's predessor, predecessor, Fernando Collor, was removed from office, in nineteen ninety-two, because of a real corruption scandal. another more recent scandal of corruption dealt with the murder of a judge, who attempted to expose his fellow judges, to the Brazilian Senate. he claimed that some of them received bribes, were receiving bribes from drug traffickers, to reduce their sentences. and others were involved in embezzling, court funds. at least in reaction to all of this people are beginning to recognize the corruption in Brazilian courts. however does this mean, change is like- likely to conquer (a cure?) or will this incident be forgotten? the good news is that President Cardoso appears to be a good politician. unlike those before him he has maintained his office position, for more than a term. and although he faces great economic social and political changes, that stem from centuries of corruption, he may be starting a trend of anticorruption, as he seeks the necessary reforms. </U>
			<EVENT DUR=":05" WHO="SS" DESC="APPLAUSE"/>
			<U WHO="S6"> um, here i also give information on the, three main political parties, and, the Workers' party um, has been known to be the the least corrupt. <U WHO="S1"> mhm <OVERLAP> mhm </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> from </OVERLAP> what i read. and um, um i'm also talking here about the, the public payroll system, because a large majority of the, government funds goes to pay um, public officials. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> um, but, <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> the majority don't go to the lower, down to the, public officials like, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> teachers or <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> they go to the politicians. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> so. that's it. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> very good. we'll wait and have uh, ask questions at the end so who is next now Anita Robert? </U>
			<U WHO="S5"> Robert. </U>

			<U WHO="S3"> okay. well, welcome to health care in Brazil. <EVENT DESC="READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"/> um, first of all Brazil ranks fourth in the world in the number of AIDS cases so this should give you, a little bit of, an idea about the quality of health care in, Brazil. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> um, now the h- public health care system in Brazil suffers from, uh two things lack of money, and unequal regional distribution of services. now there is money to be spent, and um, like Carol uh pointed out there's a lot of corruptness in the political, uh realm circle in Brazil, and so what happens is the little that is spent whether they hoard it or not, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> uh you might see a lot of politicians playing golf, um, stuff like that, possibly. um, but anyways little of it is spent and it's not spent well in fact in nineteen ninety-two a stat says that uh, Brazilian government spent roughly fifty dollars per person on health care per year. in the United States that's gonna get us maybe an immunization shot, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> for whatever hepatitis flu. um compare this with our own country the United States which is a mediocre health care spender, and uh w- our country spends, uh two thousand eight hundred and forty dollars per person, per year. so um quite a, drastic change in fact fifty-six times um more than Brazil. um, now the benefits of um, Brazil's improving health care system, um have unfortunately been shared unequally by, both region and class. again the south is the richer, area, in Brazil, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> where Sao Paulo is. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> um there's gonna be more, uh, more, buildings more hospitals better quality hospitals, um so people in the south are gonna, you know have more access to better health care. um also um, in terms of class, the rich class have, um, much more, access to better health care systems for example say the president of a business, or say a high C-E-O is gonna, h- he's gonna be um, he's gonna have available to him say uh, an ambulance, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> top class physicians, maybe even a helicopter <U WHO="S1"> mhm, mhm </U> where as a person below him, let's take out the helicopter right? um, he's gonna have, you know, physicians maybe not the top physicians he's gonna have an ambulance, but um exclude the helicopter and the best physicians, and it's kind of a hierarchy that goes down to the poor class, basically the poor get nothing. um, now we'll move on to AIDS in Brazil, um, like we mentioned in that first quote, um at which the health care system is directly responsible for, um, Marshall C Eakin um, says there are two, two main factors that have facilitated the spread of AIDS. um the first is the poorly regulated blood supply, um transfusions etcetera, um Bruce could you just scroll down a bit. um there's a quote, um that said in nineteen eight-seven twenty percent of all cases, were reportedly contacted through blood transfusions. compare that with the United States and Europe of one to two percent. that is incredible. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> i think one to two percent, i- is too high. um you know i wouldn't wanna go in for a blood transfusion and you know <SIC> contact </SIC> AIDS so, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> that's, that's kinda a- that's too bad and it's a shame. um the second factor is, um just the inability of the health care system, to, you know adequately, hold these people, um what happens is you have overflows there's not enough beds. so they get discarded, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> into the streets um basically they become outcasts of society and again we go back to the hierarchy it's all the poor people that get thrown out first <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> so what happens is, whether it be drugs needles, they just it's a vicious cycle they continue to spread the virus, um, now uh we can move into abortion. um in Brazil, um, illegal abortion has become a, increasing problem. according to <SIC> Myron </SIC> Eakin uh <SEG TYPE="READING"> sexual promiscuity and traditional patriarchal politics combine, to result in a vast amount of illegal abortions </SEG> so basically there's a lot of people in Brazil, who wanna have sex, and, the male dominated political realm, doesn't care about um females', health issues or their health rights. so they don't care to make it legal, um, get into that in a little bit. um, so uh what happens is many th- of the, of the abortions in Brazil are performed in back alleys um, in fly-by-night clinics, um obviously they're unsanitary and they're very dangerous and it's led to the hospitalization of over four hundred thousand women, and the deaths of nearly four hundred women in Brazil. um, now, back to the hierarchy of class. the rich women, they have access to information w- of whereabouts, the good clinics are. um, where they can receive a, physician, underground so to speak and um they also have the money to do it so the poor, are left with, you know paying two hundred dollars for a barber, you know, to, basically <U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> mhm </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> cut them up. </OVERLAP> so um, you know that's basically, the gist of that. um Eakin concludes, <SEG TYPE="READING"> it's clear that this human tragedy should be blamed primarily on, political culture dominated by men who have shown little concern for women's issues. </SEG> um now the economics of abortion i'm taking uh, Economics one-oh-one here microeconomics and we have this uh kind of, supplementary book, and it there was a section on abortion and i just want to share a little bit of that with you in the nineteen seventies the United States, legalized abortion. and what this did was, a lot of the physicians who were scared, to perform the abortions prior to that, came out. now, we start getting more and more of those physicians you know as it goes from the seventies to the eighties to the nineties, um that increases, um actually decreases the health concerns or health, um, the dangers in the health um, <U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> mhm </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> for that, </OVERLAP> and what happens is economically when you have, more firms or more, um people in a market what's gonna happen is competition's gonna increase, so the price is gonna lower so now many more women, are able to get these abortions in the United States and in fact now, and this quote is from, uh the middle nineteen nineties um nearly, all health related problems have ceased, in the United States, um regarding abortions. so, this could be a po- possible um, solution to Brazil's, illegal abortions problem and um, as a closing statement in the words of Leslie German, uh in Brazil <SEG TYPE="READING"> if Brazil wants to keep uh help its poor, it will have to change its health care system. </SEG> and that's health care. </U>

			<U WHO="S5"> okay. um, i'm gonna talk about the Univers- okay d- first of all do you_ have any of you heard about the Universal Decala- Declaration of Human Rights? <EVENT DESC="READING THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"/> well, Brazil happens to be a signatory, of this declaration, along with a whole b- um, other countries, and the main purpose of this Universal Declaration of Human Rights is to give citizens of Brazil, and other countries fundamenta- fundamental rights which they deserve. for example Article One states, that <SEG TYPE="READING"> all human beings are born free and equal in rights and dignity. </SEG> unfortunately, there are examples of when human rights of individuals and social groups, have been violated in Brazil. so then who defends the human rights of these minority groups and indivi- individuals? and who ensures that this declaration will be enforced? the human rights defenders risk their lives, safety, and peace of mind to defend others. human rights defenders vary from everyday citizens to state officials. often these people, are subjected to threats, intimidation and even death squads. and i have two examples, of how these defenders, um, have been intimidated. this is a, example of intimidation. um human rights activists Mato Grosso do Sul, um Gi- Giselle Marques de Carvalho Fontoura and Andenilso does Santos Assuncao and other staff members of a Human Rights Center <FOREIGN> Centro de Defesa dos Direitos Humanos, Marcal de Souza Tupa-y </FOREIGN> began, receiving death threats in October in nineteen ninety-seven, after the discovery of a cemetery that possibly contained rema- remains, of um, death squad, vis- victims. allegedly, these people were killed by policemen, from the Frontier Operations Department. Andenilso dos San- Santos Assuncao, researched the killings and disappearance of two hundred and seventy-six people, in the state in nineteen ninety-six and nineteen ninety-seven, and his report presented, was presented to the Ministry of Justice, in August in nineteen ninety-seven. um it contained ev- evidence, of the involvement of both civil, and military police. um in response to this report the delegations from the Human Rights Commission of, the Federal Chamber of Deputies, visited the region in October, twenty-third nineteen ninety-seven. on that e- occasion Giselle Marques de Carval Fontoura, received anonymous telephone calls about the secret cemetery, and cars with unknown occupants began circling her house, and parked outside her front gate. so this is just an example of how, one person tried, to do some investigation, and, they're, these people are, intimidated, they received phone threats, until they're eve- either forced into go into hiding or th- even forced to leave their country. and here's an example of how a defender was um, subjected to death squads. one activist was shot dead, on his doorstep, and another had to flee to another part of the country, for fear of his life. Francsico- Francisco Gilson Nogueira de Carvalho, a lawyer, at the Center for Human Rights and Collective Memory in Natal, um the state capital, was shot dead by six men outside his house, on the twentieth of October in nineteen ninety-six. he was killed by thirteen bullets, and most of them to the head. he had been working with special commission, set up by the State Attorney, General in May nineteen ninety-five, to investigate the activities, of the Golden Boys, which is a death squad, believed to be responsible for numerous killings, as well as cases of, tortures and death threats, carried out mainly in poor areas, of Natal. since nineteen ninety-five, allegations had been repeatedly made, that the death squad operat- operated under the deputy, se- of secre- the deputy ze- secretary, of public security. Francisco Gilson Nogueira de Carvalho killers, his killers have never been found, and an official of- investigation was clos- closed due to lack of e- evidence. this just shows that there is a need for an improvement in the judi- judicial system and prosecution in Brazil. um, it is sad to see that these people who are defending, the defenseless are also subjected, to the same, harassment that as the people that they're defending. in fact people, sometimes even accused the defenders, of um, of defending criminals. not all people view, the death squads, as violating the human rights of others. many, policemen and members of the general public truly believe, that some social groups are devoid of rights. like, if they're discriminated against and if people people harass them they believe that well they're lower and, it doesn't matter because, they're not considered at the same level as they are. um there is also there're specific articles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which defends these specific social groups. for example, Article Twenty-Five defends street children, by saying that um, what is it? um by saying that <SEG TYPE="READING"> all children shall enjoy the same, social protection. </SEG>
				<U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> so. and then there's another qu- um Article Five defends common pris- prisoners and indigenous people by saying <SEG TYPE="READING"> no one shall be subjected, to torture or to cr- cruel, inhumane or de- degrading treatment or punishment. </SEG> although Brazilian government seems to be committed to protecting, and supporting the human rights of its citizens, it pon- it s- it seems to be commi- committed to this by um, promises made by national legislation, and by national humans rights programs, which have been established and put into effect by the federal government. however, the human rights defenders, are the ones who have done most of the work to achieve the importance of human rights in Brazil. although there are still multiple, examples of blatant violations of these, articles in the, in the declaration. for example, here's an example of um, discrimination against street children. and also this is, also deals with, the harassment of defenders too. on October twelfth December nineteen ninety-three, street educators from the Catholic Church, Children's Pastor- Pastoral, Jonas Beltrao de Oliveira and Jonathan Luke Hannay, attempted to mediate a confrontation between police and street children. um, the police started beating, a sixteen-year-old girl and a twe- eleven-year-old boy. the police then allegedly hit Jonathan Hannay in the stomach, and a number of, local street traders, then started beating up on Jonas Beltrao, while people did nothing. he was left semi-conscious with a cranial fracture and perforated eardrum. after that n- incident, they both, continued to, suffer police harassment. so this just goes to show that, first of all the, street children were being harassed by the policemen, and then the policemen, um, were beating up the defenders who were trying to protect the children, and then, um, street traders jumped in and started beating up on the defenders. that just, shows that, like the general public needs to be educated, about, like human rights in the country so, they could team up and, um, defend human rights of each other. um, another example is um, on the thirteenth of November nineteen, ninety-two, the body of a thirteen-year-old, um, Jean Alves da Ca- Cunha hed- a leader of the National Streets Children Movement, was found dumped on a hillside in, Vitoria Espirito, Santos state, with gunshot wounds to the head and ear. he was last seen, on the evening of November eleventh being detained by members of justitif- justice officials, attached to juvenile courts. he was about to attend, the Third National Congress, of the National, Street Children's Movement, in Brasilia, and at the preparatory meeting he had denounced the local police, for putting pressure on street children to commit crimes, and share the pro- proceeds with them. he taped the allegations and expressed, fear for his safety. his death had, has been linked to a number of similar, death <SIC> quads </SIC> killings, allegedly committed by a police organization, in the area. the S-D-L-C military police, has been accused of his murder, and was acquitted in military court in May nineteen ninety-seven. so here's another example of when they caught, the, people who were violating the human rights and, again they're acquitted and, they weren't prosecuted. furthermore another group of, um a social class i guess you could say or, a group of people which are, commonly discriminated against in Brazil are um, just common prisoners which have been sentenced, to prison for petty crimes. um, on Dec- the second, on October second nineteen twenty-two, a rebellion erupted in one of <SIC> San </SIC> Paulo's largest prisidents, prisons. <FOREIGN> la Casa de Detencao. </FOREIGN> shock troops were sent in to quell the rebellion, and when they withdrew eleven hours later a hundred and eleven inmates were dead. eight separate inquiries into the massacre confirmed that most the prisoners had been killed by police, while defenseless in their cells. the military, justice prosector charged a hundred and twenty military police with homicide, attempted homicide and bodily harm, describing the massacre as the largest slaughter recorded, to date in a single prison in th- where the world detainees, um, the largest slaughter recorded to date in a single prison in the world. detainees prison sentences were arbitrarily and illicitly, turned into death sentences. they were originally sent for petty crimes and they ended up, dying for no reason. however, the hard work and devotion, and persistence of these Human Rights defenders is making a difference in Brazil. the human rights defenders, including police, have become involved in collaborating in a joint effort to tackle human rights in Brazil... human rights violations in Brazil <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> thanks. </U>

			<U WHO="S4"> there are lots of examples out <OVERLAP> there, just like this. </OVERLAP>

			<U WHO="S1">
				<OVERLAP> it didn't surprise </OVERLAP> me, but um, yeah <OVERLAP> mhm </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S8">
				<OVERLAP> not </OVERLAP> like even surprising like cuz just from what we've learned like i can see that someone would be like that but just like, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> not like to ha- i don't have a face but just to have like a name like that person has a name just like so typical that someone like, like someone has_ you know? like it's like a real person. </U>

			<U WHO="S9">
				<OVERLAP> yeah </OVERLAP> Anita did you say, the uh military police that, did that massacre did they get convicted? or, i didn't hear, what you said </U>
			<U WHO="S5"> um, no well, i think they did, later on, yeah, <U WHO="S9"> oh </U> for that massacre but i mean i'm sure there've been others, where they weren't, <U WHO="S9"> mhm </U> but yeah they were charged with that, um </U>
			<U WHO="S9"> were they found guilty? <OVERLAP> do you know? uhuh </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S5">
				<OVERLAP> i think so, </OVERLAP> yeah. and later on it explains that, they were eventually convicted. but that's just one of the few instances <U WHO="S9"> mm </U> where, they have (xx) </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> Allison? </U>
			<U WHO="S8"> i thought like um, when, Bruce said that about like how in America how like abortion has become cheaper now just because, it's, like with the_ there's not as m- like competition now like how like, if Brazil, legalized, abortion like then maybe it would be made cheaper for the people there and like more people could get it, so like why wouldn't they? like i don't understand like, <U WHO="S4">
					<OVERLAP> just </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> i guess </OVERLAP> that has to do with the corrupt politics. </U>
			<U WHO="S4"> yeah the the, the whole thing about the patriarchal, politics, i i think it's, it's to the point like, you know i- like with part of the nineteen seventies, our politicians were, you know they did- they didn't expand their horizons to women's feelings. you know what i mean? so, it's just, they gotta think about the women first you know and they if it's_ if they if they're thinking about themselves they're not gonna, look into this whole <OVERLAP> abortion thing. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1">
				<OVERLAP> mhm, mhm. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S9"> isn't uh, the reason that they're not, legalizing it is because it's a religious thing? <U WHO="SU-f"> mhm </U> they don't believe in, abortion? is that possible? </U>
			<U WHO="S3"> i don't know </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> you guys wanna answer that? </U>
			<U WHO="S3"> i guess that's right cuz it, it's mainly, <U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> Catholic mhm </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> Catholicism </OVERLAP> and uh, (xx) </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> and we didn't even, it's still illegal and we didn't, even divorce, was considered, inappropriate and we didn't really have divorce until, in the eighties, and abortion is taboo. we are not even supposed to talk about it. so Betty </U>
			<U WHO="S8"> but i feel like it would benefit their society. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> i know, i know. a lot of things as we saw in that, Capital Sins movie, is doesn't even make sense. it seems that there is a child running the country at times. so, Betty? </U>
			<U WHO="S10"> well that's all i was gonna say, even if it was legalized, there's still like, a cultural, religious pressure like, people still like </U>
			<EVENT WHO="S6" DESC="CLOSES DOOR"/>
			<U WHO="S1"> thank you Carol </U>
			<U WHO="S3"> people still what? </U>
			<U WHO="S10"> people still wouldn't have abortions. like i was just, agreeing with them </U>
			<U WHO="S3"> well there's a- the- there there's gonna be a same amount of people, be- because there's already, a third of the possible, babies that could be born are, being killed. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> so tha- it's gonna happen, regardless it's just whether or not, it's gonna be safe, <OVERLAP> you know. </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S10">

				</U> and, leading to, women surviving, you know, not just, hospitalize and die. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> mhm, yeah? </U>
			<U WHO="S11"> um, i agree i think abortion should be illegal but don't you also maybe think that, like </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> you think it should be legal, or illegal? </U>
			<U WHO="S11"> i think it should be illegal, <U WHO="SU-f">
					<OVERLAP> (wow he's) got honesty </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> abortion should be illegal. </OVERLAP> but i mean maybe like in, in Brazil like it should just be a threat, you know like to like you you know the men and the women, you know like you have to watch like there's a lot of diseases like you can't just have an abortion. like y- some people will say like (well) worse (thing's) worse you have an abortion but, it's not that anymore you know it's, more than that it's, the diseases are something more <U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> mhm mhm </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> you have to think, </OVERLAP> people should think. </U>
			<U WHO="S8"> like a long time ago like the worst thing the worst thing that could happen was like you'd get pregnant like when my like when my mom was like, a te- like, a young adult like that was like the worst thing like you'd get pregnant but now like it goes beyond that it goes like, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> a pregnancy fine so you have a baby and like if worse came to worst you'd, have it give it up for adoption, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> like cuz you couldn't take care of it but now there's like, things that go along with like it, that just you can't, like get rid of like something you can't put it up for adoption when you get like, AIDS or something. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> hm. yeah </U>
			<U WHO="S12"> so basically um, the, one, that most people in Brazil the way they get AIDS is through blood transfusions? </U>
			<U WHO="S3"> um twenty percent of all AIDS cases are, through blood transfusions, s- which is a lot, unfortunately. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> right, so it's not necessarily most, but it's a large percentage. </U>
			<U WHO="S7"> i- is that the mo- that's the, most frequently (cause?) </U>
			<U WHO="S3"> um </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> twenty percent. </U>
			<U WHO="S3"> yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="S7"> oh. </U>
			<U WHO="S9"> was it twenty percent, of AIDS cases, are from blood transfusions <U WHO="SU-m"> yep </U> or twenty percent <OVERLAP> of blood transfusions </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S3">
				<OVERLAP> whatever they </OVERLAP> do um, there's- there's, <OVERLAP> i read something about </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> they're probably not careful </OVERLAP>
				</U> um, some famous painters <U WHO="S9"> mhm </U> and, this is like the only, thing where, um a person of high status is gonna, get you know, whatever screwed over by society, and these painters had uh, some disease i don't know what it was but you re- they required d- blood transfusions like frequently, they acquired AIDS because of it. <OVERLAP> so </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S7">
				<OVERLAP> it just </OVERLAP> shows like the hastiness of like the ho- like, here in America like, when you give blood like they're so careful with it <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> and it goes through like so much like you know through hospitals and they're so like conscientious of like, who they give it to and who's like the donor, and i just feel like there it's, like someone, very naive is running like the medical, system as well as the political system. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> mhm. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> i have to ask you a question not, not regarding the, blood transfusion but, you said that l- and then like the all the rich people live in the south and like the all the good hospita- who was the one that was talking about that? <U WHO="S3"> me </U> that all the hospitals, like the good, hospitals are in the south of Brazil. are the, the good schools i don't know if you know or not but ar- is it also like the schooling and education the good schools are located in the south? </U>

			<U WHO="S13"> yeah. that's about the magazine and, we, i am very proud that, um, i am in the project s- since the beginning, because i worked for, Exame magazine the business magazine and, then Exame decide to launch this new magazine two years ago, and, it's a very, it's going very well, in Brazil. uh we are, we've almost three hundred thousand, uh issues per month. oh that's good, <OVERLAP> circulation. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1">
				<OVERLAP> (xx) </OVERLAP> right. <U WHO="S13"> yeah. </U> yeah. taking into consideration again we need, to think in terms of, Brazilian reality. so in America it's one thing if you have a country, uh where, th- there is such a high illiteracy rate, it's a tremendous accomplishment to have, such a successful magazine. Exame the fact that uh you worked in Exame, (it) facilitate your hiring, at, you being hired at Voce. (xx) </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> uh, yes, because um, i- i was uh uh, i was working for Exame and i was writing for Exame this same kind of subject. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> that uh, uh Voce published now (xx) so, i was in the um, uh i was working with the articles about uh career and, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> education, at Exame so, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> i, i was promoted by (xx) i was hired by decision. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> any questions i'm curious to know, what is she doing here? a senior editor a chief editor, of a high ranking business magazine in Brazil, what is she doing here did she travel just to visit us our class? or, <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> how did you get here what are you, <U WHO="SU-f"> fifteen minutes </U> doing here? so i don't know if you guys have this question i want you guys asking questions i will try to be quiet. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> why are you here? </U>
			<EVENT DUR="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/>
			<U WHO="S13"> um, uh as i i've written, uh for Voce the inte- international experience, is a good thing to, to have in your in your career. so, i decided that i needed have to, i need have one and then i applied for the Michigan Journalist Fellows, is a, a special program, uh that the, University of Michigan has. and it's, you have to apply for it, it's, twelve, uh, we we are twelve Americans journalists and six international journalists. every ye- year you have a different, journalist here. so we come here and we can, uh we can study whatever we want at the University. so some of us are at the medical school some of uh us are at the law school, i am at the business school. so, in the, it's almost done. i, i'm here since September and, uh it's going to finish now in April. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> do you like it here? </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> here? i like it very much. i'd like to stay here for more two years. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> yeah? <U WHO="S13"> yeah </U> do you think you'll come back? </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> i have to come back, yeah? i, i have to work. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> so, you, run the magazine still while you're here? </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> no i i'm i'm uh, an employee a continuing uh uh an employee but i'm not working for the magazine. someone is, working my, <OVERLAP> place there </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="SU-f">
				<OVERLAP> oh so </OVERLAP> when you go back you're gonna, <U WHO="SU-f"> yeah </U> start working for it again? </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> do you know um, a magazine here that this is like, like, like? <U WHO="SU-f"> parallel to </U> yeah like <OVERLAP> parallel to? </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="SU-m">
				<OVERLAP> similar </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13"> similar, here in States? uh it's Fast Company, have you heard about? Fast Company? <U WHO="SU-f">
					<OVERLAP> it's kinda like Forbes </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> it's a very good </OVERLAP> magazine. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-m"> hm </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> it's slightly different from Forbes and <U WHO="SU-f"> ah </U> Fortune. </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> because uh Fortune and Forbes, and Exame in Brazil, they talk about business, they talked about companies, and Voce and Fast Company talk about people, about, uh you and how, your dreams and your ambitions and, your education, so it's n- we don- we don't talk about, logistics or, investments. we talk about how can, how, can you improve your, your job or your company. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> um, Lisa, i had the pleasure to have her as a guest in my M-B-A class, this week? <U WHO="S13"> yeah </U> on Tuesday. and uh, all the M-B-As they knew, what Fast Company is. so i think it's something that the general public, is not really aware of it maybe only people, in business or with more interest <OVERLAP> i_ perhaps </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="SU-f">
				<OVERLAP> yeah. yeah it's not, </OVERLAP> it's not a weekly magazine but you can find at Borders, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> or, or other </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> they knew where it was, yeah. and one thing that you mentioned that, why have you been taking so many cla- i, i understand that um, the guest, the the calibre of the guest that's why i, i, mentioned to the class get the chance because we have a high-ranking executive, that we can ask any questions regarding the economy or maybe gender issues etcetera. and your colleagues at the Michigan Journalist Fellows, are people to give you an idea, from Wall Street Journal, um B-B-C, of uh London, um <U WHO="S13"> Washington <OVERLAP> Post </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> Washington Financial Times, A-B-C news </OVERLAP>
				<OVERLAP> Post, etcetera. so it's a </OVERLAP> very selective fellowship. so we are fortunate to have Lisa here. Lisa you mentioned that you've been taking it- the the program again, to my understanding, you have the freedom, <U WHO="S13"> yeah </U> to, pick and choose to select any classes you would like to take while you are here for this school year <U WHO="S13"> yeah </U> from September through April. <U WHO="S13"> yeah </U> and you mentioned that you've been taking most of your classes in the business school. why <OVERLAP> is that? </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13">
				<OVERLAP> all of </OVERLAP> them. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> can you please, um? </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> um, first because i'm curious about, Master in Business Administration, because i've written many articles for Exame and then for Voce about, M-B-As and how, why s- a lot of Brazilians are taking so, are travelling abroad to to take an M-B-A. and uh i'm curious about, what- what does uh, Michig- uh, Business School does. so i came here, because i was curious and, secondly be- because i work for a business magazine and it's important to me, to know, what's going on, in business what is the, the newest, uh, (professional) or something like that <U WHO="S1"> trend or </U> and, the the last reason is that i'm i'm writing a book about M-B-A, like how to get an M-B-A, for Brazilians. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> that's great. <U WHO="S13"> yeah </U> now here we have a female we've read we've seen videos documentaries, all this we all know that the typical um, stereotype of a Brasilia- is a Latin man is a macho, Brazilian man. we've read and seen documentaries we've, seen presentations about the, paternalistic um, a- and all the the, all the, the male, controlled society, problems, and issues we've seen. so we have a female executive. do you guys have any questions on, gender issues that you would like to ask? </U>
			<U WHO="S12"> um are there, executives, um that are men, i- for your magazine that work for your magazine? </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> yeah. the the director, uh is a man. </U>
			<U WHO="S12"> and a- what, if you don't mind me asking like what's the comparison of like, your wages? </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> oh. their ages or my age? </U>
			<U WHO="SU-m">
				<OVERLAP> the wage like mo- </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S12">
				<OVERLAP> their- no wage, the money that you (make?) </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13">
				<OVERLAP> oh. oh, the </OVERLAP> money. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> the salary. </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> oh. um... i think that the, guys, in the same age and the same level, uh, as i am, they earn more than me. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> so there is still the inequality. Anita? </U>
			<U WHO="S5"> what about the number of women working in your area? as the men are there is it equal, the men? </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> in journalism? </U>
			<U WHO="S5"> yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> in journalism are more, women than men. <U WHO="S5"> oh? </U> yeah. at the the journalism schools in Brazil are more, women than men. but uh, yeah, the the men are on, top positions yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> they <OVERLAP> still controlling. </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S13">
					<OVERLAP> still, yeah </OVERLAP>
				</U> Morgan? </U>
			<U WHO="S7"> would it be possible for you or like another woman to run the magazine, or would that not be like? <OVERLAP> like? </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13">
				<OVERLAP> my </OVERLAP> i i said to- the director is a a, a man, but um, below him, there is uh i- uh, my, boss, she's a woman. and there is </U>
			<U WHO="S7"> so it cou- it could be possible it's </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> it could be possible <U WHO="S1"> mhm. </U> yeah. there is other, women that runs magazine in the same company because the company, publishes about thirty magazines a month. different kind of magazines. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> um you mentioned and, in my other, in the language course i teach, we watch uh Globo (xx) showing uh women, and how much, the women's role has changed in in the last decade or so. and one of the the, one of the segments they show that many more women complete second grade than man, and their number is even higher, at the u- a- at the college level. so there are more women graduating from college than men. so, in in the future as you mentioned <U WHO="S13">
					<OVERLAP> yes </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> we're </OVERLAP> gonna be seeing more and more women, <U WHO="S13">
					<OVERLAP> i think so. </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> in i think </OVERLAP> decision making positions hopefully. </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> yeah. um, i think the women are growing (xx) so um, gr- growing up, quickly. <U WHO="S1"> mhm. </U> and, um, i think very soon, we are going to share, the same positions that man, and uh and in not, just in my company but, we have seen uh, some women, uh getting C-E-O positions in Brazil, but s- it's a few yet. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> and compared to this country we see that i think only five percent of the C-E-Os, are women. so in the in the major, <OVERLAP> corporations so </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13">
				<OVERLAP> but i </OVERLAP> i read a in- an interesting article at- uh, the New York Times, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> showing that uh, between the five hundred, biggest companies, in United States less than five percent, of the C-E-Os are women. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> but in the dot-coms company, they are <OVERLAP> almost </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> women </OVERLAP>
				</U> forty percent. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> oh yeah. mhm. uh who is the owner of eBay? it's a woman. from the Bay City Area, in uh, in San Francisco. uh who runs, Hewlett Packard? a woman. if if we would start, paying attention an- we could_ the list would go on and on yes which is, what do you guys, what do you guys think are the implications of that? more women in power at least in the dot-com companies. what do you guys, what would you guess, one of the implications, would be? </U>
			<U WHO="S11"> well obviously the computer's like of the future so, in the future the women, are gonna, i'm not gonna say take over but, they're gonna obviously have equal, and, there'll be equal amounts, of women in, in each company. i feel li- i feel like right now though like in, at least in the United States ev- they're equal. like they're looked at equally businesswise except there's not as many as them, because, because of the past but now, i don't know exactly how to put this but i don't know i just feel like this correlation as, business goes on, the women working will increase. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> mhm. and then, consequently i guess they would hire, more women and put more women in in, decision-making positions <U WHO="SU-f">
					<OVERLAP> yeah i </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> (so) we would </OVERLAP> have more women in power. </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> some biggest companies, uh here in States, i- us in Brazil has, kind of rules that they have to have at least twenty or twenty-five percent <OVERLAP> (xx) </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> here's a quota yeah </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> yeah, </OVERLAP> for women so. <U WHO="S1"> yeah </U> but it's, it's not, enough <OVERLAP> yet so. twenty percent </OVERLAP>
				<EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1">
				<OVERLAP> mhm. yeah no not enough not enough. </OVERLAP> um, anyone has any more questions that uh, any final thoughts or? the, one of the questions that comes to my mind when he mentioned more women and that they're treated weakl- equally, do you as men and women in this class, do you personally, feel that you are treated equally as women and do you guys feel that you treat women equally and vice versa? is that a general? </U>
			<U WHO="S12"> in this class? </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> yeah. you, like, you Kelly. do you feel that, your classmates the male, um classmates do they treat you, or the professors do they treat you in the same way, that they treat the male, <U WHO="S12">
					<OVERLAP> uhuh </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> in </OVERLAP> the room? </U>
			<U WHO="S12"> yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> there there is a tendency there there there is, some thought that perhaps at least in the the high school level, and we still have, uh, uh Ver- what is the name Versar? we- we have so many, colleges that are female only and that is- Vassar? is that the r- <OVERLAP> correct pronunciation? </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="SU-f">
					<OVERLAP> Vassar. </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<U WHO="SU-f"> mhm. </U> Vassar? </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> right. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> uh, and in high school they feel that if it is, uh, not a coed but if it is a women only class, and the entire school, the girls will achieve and they will perform better and they will, get higher grades in tests etcetera. because some girls, particularly in high school, they feel, a bit, not that they feel harassed but, they, they feel that um, the presence of the guys, will no- not permit them, to participate as much. they are, reluctant to raise their hands and say that they didn't understand and ask the teacher to, explain again, uh a subject matter. so there are some people that believe in that, and they go even to the college. what do you guys think would be, the the consequences of that? when we, you mentioned your boss being a man. so is there a place is there a country is there a city or a company, that, is exclusively for, females or males? or in the real world, we are gonna be hired and have male and female colleagues... what is your question? </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> no i was gonna say that, i think a lot of times guy teachers are nicer to girls. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> the guys turn? </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> the guy professors, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> male professors, are nicer to the females in the class. </U>
			<U WHO="S9"> definitely. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> are nicer? </U>
			<U WHO="S9"> yeah, definitely. <OVERLAP> i think it's just </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1"> they treat the girls better <U WHO="SS"> yeah </U> than the, the guys? </U>
			<U WHO="S9"> even the girl <OVERLAP> professors (do that) </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S11">
				<OVERLAP> but i maybe it's for like, </OVERLAP> the men, i don't know maybe that, they just feel most of the guys really won't care and won't, do the stuff and girls are more likely to, complete the work and, i don't know but i've known, i think that male professors are much, <OVERLAP> nicer to females. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S9">
				<OVERLAP> and female pros- </OVERLAP> professors also, <U WHO="SU-m">
					<OVERLAP> yeah. </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> are always </OVERLAP> a- nicer to the girls, cuz i feel like, <U WHO="SU-m">
					<OVERLAP> i just feel like (there's more work) </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> they're also women so like </OVERLAP> they feel like uh, i know like in my French class i'm like, there's like two guys in the class and i'm one of 'em and the teacher hates me. <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> for no reason she's b- <U WHO="SU-m">
					<OVERLAP> there- there's reasons for that (i'm sure) </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/>
				<OVERLAP> she says i'm, i'm not </OVERLAP> good enough. um no there's no reasons i feel like, it's cuz i'm a male. <OVERLAP> you know? </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1">
				<OVERLAP> it's interesting. </OVERLAP> because, they've, they've had uh they've made studies John. at least in the past i don't know a ninety-nine study. but i remember reading many in the early nineties, where according to those studies, the professors, regardless of their gender, they called on, the guys, the male, students more often than, the females. so here are the females me me me, and they're okay, you <OVERLAP> please Dave. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="SU-f">
				<OVERLAP> i think, i think </OVERLAP> i think that's from so long ago <OVERLAP> though and </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="SS">
					<OVERLAP> yeah. </OVERLAP>
				</U>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1">
				<OVERLAP> so i think that is uh, not reality anymore. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S3">
				<OVERLAP> (xx) easier. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="SS"> (xx) </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f">
				<OVERLAP> (i mean when women) would have had no role in (xx) </OVERLAP> society at all. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> it has changed a lot. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> and i don't think gender plays a role in, getting jobs either. <U WHO="S1"> mhm. </U>
				<OVERLAP> if any i think women have the benefit. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13">
				<OVERLAP> but i think i- i think i- the- </OVERLAP> when you are working Brazil is, y- in you have, uh, there is a place for promotion and i i uh i believe that the the directors, first think, in the guys. like, the professors <OVERLAP> did </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> mhm, </OVERLAP> mhm. </U> in the past like. or who i- i am going to promote? oh, maybe Dave or (xx) or- hmm, maybe some (xx) </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> and what would be the reasons why is that? is that because he's got a family <OVERLAP> to support and the female is supposed to be single or? </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13">
				<OVERLAP> i think, no, i think because they </OVERLAP> i think because they play soccer together <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"/> and they go out for dinner together </U>
			<U WHO="S9"> drink beers together. </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> uh s- so <OVERLAP> they are </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> here </OVERLAP>
				</U> always together so, they don't remember me because i- i- i don't go play soccer with them so. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> mhm the old boys' club, here in the state of Michigan a woman, actually sued a country club a golf club, that wouldn't allow her, as a member <OVERLAP> as a female to be a member in the state of Michigan. </OVERLAP>

				</U> and her argument was, wait a minute. all my colleagues all my male colleagues all my, my competition, they've been, bringing, their clients, to the golf club, and dining and wining them, and that's where the major contracts are, not necessarily signed but that's where the decisions <U WHO="S13">
					<OVERLAP> you start relationships, (xx) </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> are made, and i am in a </OVERLAP> huge disadvantage for not being able, to do the same. she sued and she won. Erin? </U>
			<U WHO="S14"> there's a golf club, like, in New York, that women can't join. only men. </U>
			<U WHO="S9"> like single <U WHO="SU-m">
					<OVERLAP> all all, all clubs are like that. </OVERLAP>

				<OVERLAP> men can join, but single women, </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> cannot. </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> can't. </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S14">
					<OVERLAP> no they're not. </OVERLAP>
				</U> cuz <U WHO="SU-m">
					<OVERLAP> a- almost every single one i've ever been (in) </OVERLAP>
				</U>
				<OVERLAP> they associate a single woman with like uh, </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S14"> baloney </U>
				<U WHO="SU-m"> i swear to God </U>
				<U WHO="S14"> ours isn't. </U> like, like divorce like being divorced <OVERLAP> or, </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S1">
					<OVERLAP> perhaps </OVERLAP>
				</U> right </U>
			<U WHO="S14">
				<OVERLAP> and then they- </OVERLAP> they have so many days <OVERLAP> throughout the week </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="S9">
					<OVERLAP> it's like a negative connotation i think. </OVERLAP>
				</U> that women can't play. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> i beg your pardon? </U>
			<U WHO="S14"> there are many days throughout the week, that <OVERLAP> women can't play golf, that only men are allowed to play. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1"> oh, yeah yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="S14"> and they have a certain, for each day that they can play it's certain times that they can play. </U>

			<U WHO="S13"> i think it's pretty commo- common that uh, the guys go out and then they became friends or something like that and, so... they are remembered, before the the the women. <OVERLAP> for promotions and </OVERLAP>

				<OVERLAP> what we did </OVERLAP> the very first week of class, we saw a video. and remember what we, talked about after seeing that video? that i mentioned that in term- in s- in several aspects, Brazil in in certain segments o- of uh society and development etcetera, e- everything, economic health issues, Brazil is about a hun- wha- what did we see in that first video the forest the people who were those people? where were they? the first video we saw. not the <OVERLAP> abortion one </OVERLAP>
				<U WHO="SU-f">
					<OVERLAP> (xx) </OVERLAP>
				</U> but the the family. <OVERLAP> yes? </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S5">
				<OVERLAP> the people, </OVERLAP> from the south going north, the north going south <OVERLAP> (xx) </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S1">
				<OVERLAP> right. so </OVERLAP> the family left their their <FOREIGN> podana </FOREIGN> and went to the north because their country gave them free land. but they got there who did they encounter? who- whose land was that? who lived there? </U>
			<U WHO="SS"> the Indians </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> the Indians. the native Brazilians. so i compare to the the time, to the frontier, to to the to the time a hundred years ago, when people were moving west. <U WHO="SU-f"> uhuh </U> and the Indians the Native Americans were fighting for their land and that's what we saw in Brazil in the nineties. and we read what i do i send them by email, articles, this week if i- last week there was a conflict. there were still native Brazilians fighting for their land, and they being killed and they're shooting people etcetera. so, in that aspect of, in the work force, Brazil is still behind. we are catching on, but we still behind. so i think that in the future <OVERLAP> we see more and more women </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13">
				<OVERLAP> yeah yeah used to say </OVERLAP> in Brazil that two <FOREIGN> Brasis </FOREIGN> two different, Brazils. like we have uh a wealth, Brasilia uh Brazil, that people go to a school go to the university, um live in the cities and we have, the other Brasilia that is poor and a lot of people (xx) uh, fighting for land (rights.) <U WHO="S1"> mhm. </U> yeah. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> and we've watched many documentaries and they were, amazed. i started showing them, a little bit of the bleak the the, <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> the negative side of it, because as a tourist, you don't see you don't have an opportunity to see. but gradually we've been watching videos that show both, and we i, believe that now they have a somewhat accurate, idea of what is Brazil. a third world country a poor country but you get to Sao Paulo, and you see all that progress and all, how much people have accomplished, in the financial, uh success of </U>
			<U WHO="S13"> i- i think Brazil has changed a lot, and, uh, we, we are improving our situation. in the, i think the last ten years, <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> we've changed a lot since the inflation, uh got down. and, um, i th- i i believe that, we we have, a lot of, um, uh good conditions to grow um, but we have problems a lot of problems yes. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> but things are improving and i think that's the idea, that the class, towards, now that we are towards the end of the semester, we are coming to conclude that, it's not that bad. there's a lot of horrible things happening, but people are trying, <OVERLAP> um to improve. </OVERLAP>
			</U>
			<U WHO="S13">
				<OVERLAP> and and and </OVERLAP> if you work hard, it's like here. if you work hard, you can go to the uni- university. it's not_ because uh, it's it's hard to get there, but, uh i came from a family that's not rich. my family is uh, is from (Ca- Caldisi) and, i went- i went to a, a_ i went um </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> the top university. </U>
			<U WHO="SU-f"> (federal) school yeah. (federal) university and, it's very good and my four sisters, three sisters and uh one brother also went, studied there and, so. it's- it's possible that you, change your, your, poor destiny like that. <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> i think a lot of people do that in Brazil. </U>
			<U WHO="S1"> and there's a lot of hope. <U WHO="S13"> yeah </U> and that's what keeps people going. any final, thoughts? because it is, even beyond the time that we usually end <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="APPLAUSE"/> thank you very much. </U>
