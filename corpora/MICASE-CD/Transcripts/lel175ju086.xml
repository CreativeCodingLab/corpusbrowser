know how sometimes they're a little sloppy getting parked. and he got out of his car, and he tripped over something, and he fell, pizzas and all, right on a rosebush, and really did a lot of damage to, those pizzas. <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> and to himself and to that rosebush and he was so, flummoxed by all of this, that, he got into his vehicle, and backed out of the yard as fast as he could go, driving right over the rosebush, <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"/> and you know what? the next spring, that rosebush, came back to life and grew, thrived and had roses, and you could say, that that rosebush was pretty hardy, to be able to endure all of this stuff, and if you said that, you'd probably be right in some vernacular sense, but you wouldn't be right as a gardener, unless what the rosebush really had done, was survive the cold winter. because we recall, to gardeners, hardy, means, the ability, to tolerate, cold. now plants are rated, on their ability to tolerate cold. some plants, don't tolerate cold, very well at all. they probably, naturally came from, warm places where it never got very cold. but because we bring things into the trade and sell them commercially, we're likely to, have available to us, plants that, are native to warm places, and are brought here where it's, perhaps not quite, warm enough to make them happy. or if we're ordering from a catalog, and we say oh that's a nice looking plant i'd like to have it in my garden, it's terribly important that you check, its hardiness rating, to be sure that if you plant it in your garden, it's not gonna freeze to death, in the first, winter. so plants are rated, by, how, cold, a winter, they can tolerate, they're rated for hardiness by how cold a winter, they can tolerate, and how cold a winter they can tolerate, is described, by geographic places, in the world, and for us here in the United States, it's described, by geographic places in the United States. so the United States and Canada and Mexico and anywhere else for that matter, it's been studied a little bit like this, is divided up into hardiness zones... and a, part of the world is in the same hardiness zone, if the, average minimum temperatures in the wintertime, are all within the same, range. now we can divide, the country into hardiness zones, that are, kind of broad, ranges of minimum winter temperatures. zone A is a cold zone, it's up there in the, northern part of our state and, tends to, go across parts of the country that get really cold in the winter, and then there's zone B which is down a little bit farther and, most of us down here in Michigan are in there, zone C is a little farther, down and some really warm places, are down there in zone D. so if you look in your guide, you'll see that some plants, are rated, for their hardiness, with a letter A B C D, and that's saying, what geography what geographic places, you can plant these plants, and expect them to be able to survive, the cold winter. <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> now one of the things, that plants have to do right, in order to survive the cold winter, they have to be able to tell, when the cold winter, is over. that's why if you're a gardener, like me, it might feel pretty nice, to have a few warm days like this in February... but all is not right with the world... this is too warm for February, if this continues, for very much longer, plants, are gonna get fooled. they're gonna, think that it's spring, they're gonna come out, start to try to grow, and it's very likely that we'll have at least one more (chilling) frost, before spring is really really here. so this kind of weather, is likely to be, hard, on plants. it's, especially likely to be hard on plants, if the plants aren't, already, used to, a hard, winter, if they're used to, a few days like this, indicating that, springtime, is ready, or, if they come out a little bit early, and get hit with some cold, weather that's still yet to come, plants that are very good, at, tolerating, cold, will be less damaged, than plants that aren't so good, at tolerating cold. now sometimes, we grow plants, in our home landscapes, that we've chosen, from somewhat warmer climes they're near the northern, limit of their hardiness tolerance. they might be a zone C plant, that we're trying to, squeeze in here, into zone B, and most winters we'll be able to get away with it, and some winters we might not be able to get away with it. but if we're cagey, knowledgeable gardeners, there are things that we can do, that will make it, more likely, that we get, away with it, that we enable our, plant to grow even though it's pushing the, envelope of the limits of hardiness of cold tolerance. now we can take a page, out of little animals' books as gardeners, and learn something, about how to, survive, a cold winter, especially a cold winter, that's likely to have, a few premature thaws like we're experiencing right now. if we're a tree, or a shrub or a bush, that isn't very tolerant, of freezing weather especially, once we start to grow, we break our dormancy, we, dissolve the ethylene glycol that we've stuck into ourselves to, resist freezing, or we've reinstalled the, liquid that's in the, phloem and xylem, that's moving around inside of us, we've started to grow again, we're much more susceptible, to frost damage, than, if we were still packaged up, more or less dormant, hibernating as it were, getting through the cold winter. so let's look at a little animal, that's gonna hibernate, through the cold winter. here's the badger, he's gonna dig a hole somewhere, and crawl in there, and sleep, until, it's time, to come out. now the badger, could, pick, a nice, warm, sunny, slope, south facing, to dig his hole. or he could, pick a slope that faced east that got the morning sunshine, to dig his hole. or he could, dig his hole on a west facing slope to get the afternoon sun. or he could dig his hole, on the north facing slope so that he didn't get any sun at all. and we could just think for a little bit, about where he wants to dig his hole. he knows and she knows, where you dig the hole, and they do it quite predictably and quite reliably... they wanna dig the hole, on the north facing slope. they wanna dig the hole on the north facing slope because, the north facing slope is the last, direction, to warm up, in the spring. it gets the least amount of direct sun. so it's likely to stay, frozen, longer, the south facing slope, is gonna warm up right away when we get one of these thaws with the sun beating down on it. and the west slope will, warm up a little bit sooner the east slope gets the morning sun when it's still cool so, it won't warm up quite so quick, but that north facing slope, it's least likely to warm up prematurely and by the time, the ground around the hole in which the little animal is hibernating, warms up, the little animal, is pretty sure, that if it comes out, it's not gonna get its tail frozen. so if we have, a magnolia tree, that we're trying to grow in our gardens cuz we really like, magnolia trees but, it really comes from, a little farther south, and it's really growing here a little bit farther north than, it's likely to be able to survive, which side of our house, should we plant it on? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> north </U> <U WHO="S1"> the north or the... if the north side of our house is smack up against a, condo, what would be the second best bet? </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> west. </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> west. </U> <U WHO="SS"> east. </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> east. </U> <U WHO="S1"> east east. east. okay. <PAUSE DUR=":08"/> now do we have to check, when we plant annuals, to see whether they're hardy or not? </U> <PAUSE DUR=":08"/> <U WHO="SU-f"> no. </U> <U WHO="S1"> no. good courageous no coming right out here. no. why not...? annuals spend the winter, in a seed packet in your cupboard... so it's only, perennial plants, that have a hardiness rating. now if you looked in the, houseplant section of our guide, would we expect to see, hardiness ratings? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> no. </U> <U WHO="S1"> another courageous voice somewhere? <U WHO="SU-f"> no </U> no. no. because these plants are gonna spend the winter where? <U WHO="SS"> inside </U> in your house. <EVENT DUR=":13" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> i may have misspelled that as you know i'm a past master of misspelling things. these are the plants that are not annuals, and basically they're not houseplants either. these are the plants that, need to live through, a winter outdoors. now, in the trade, we have a very narrow meaning for perennials, and we have a more, broader, more botanical meaning for perennials. the broader more botanical meaning for perennials, is plants that live for more, than one year. and it's in contrast, with annuals. so things like trees, and bushes, would be, perennials, in the botanical sense. <PAUSE DUR=":06"/> but gardeners, and the trade, have a more narrow, view, of what is meant by a perennial we have a kind of special, narrow meaning of perennial a perennial, is a plant, whose aboveground parts, are annual... but the belowground parts, survive for many years. so a perennial, in the narrow, sense in the sense of the commercial trade, is a plant like a peony... that isn't there in the wintertime, unless you left the dead leaves, lying on the ground, where it grew last year. the only part, that's there and alive, during the winter, is the part, underground. and then in the spring, the perennial, grows aboveground, and whatever it does it does up there, and then in the fall when frosts come the aboveground part, dies down, and it makes it through the winter, underground. do perennials in this narrow, commercial sense, have hardiness ratings? <PAUSE DUR=":06"/> yes. they have to, make it through the winter outdoors, buried in the ground. now what could you do, to your perennial, to help it, get through, the winter? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> <OVERLAP> put it under cover </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> <OVERLAP> mulch it. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> mulch it. why would we wanna mulch it? </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> to keep it warm. </U> <U WHO="S1"> to keep it, warm, is the immediate, imagined, possible, reason. but that would be, wrong. but i thank Sven for offering that <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> to us so that we can discuss it. thank you Sven. um, what we're really trying to do, it's just like the magnolia tree, that we planted, on the north side of the house. why did we put that on the north side of the house? we wanted to keep it <U WHO="SS"> cold </U> cold. hm? so when we, put a big thick layer, of leaves, over where, our peony came out of the ground, last spring, that big thick layer of leaves, is to keep the ground, where the peony is trying to get through the winter, cold. a layer of thermal, resistance, to keep the ground, cold. in fact, if the ground, freezes, the water in the ground, what's the water in the ground do? <U WHO="SU-f"> expands </U> expands. and then when the ground melts, what's the water in the ground do? <U WHO="SU-f"> contracts </U> dribbles down into the cracks. there's usually more cracks up at the top. that fills in with water that's running around on the surface of your yard. when that freezes it, expands again, and if we have two or three of these freeze thaw cycles, during the winter, it will heave, the roots, of your peony, or whatever other, quote perennial, you might have, in the ground, right up out of the ground, where it will really freeze or come to other harm. so, we mulch the perennials, not only to keep them cold. <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> but to protect them, from frost heaving. <PAUSE DUR=":07"/> trees are sometimes part of our landscape. do trees have hardiness, ratings? </U> <U WHO="SS"> yeah. </U> <U WHO="S1"> yes. trees have hardiness ratings because, they live for many many years, they're sitting out there, taking the cold, they have hardiness ratings. trees are very special creatures on our landscape. trees are likely to be, very very old. some of them ar- might be young little things that you just planted but, especially big trees, are likely to be old. they're likely to carry with them, a sense of history. they're likely to, carry with them a sense of permanence. a sense of awe, a lot of the, aesthetics, that we associate, with the plants in our landscape, are represented, by trees. trees also, take a very long time, to get to be trees, so we can't, stick trees in and pull trees out, wherever we want them, like we can annuals. that's the, one of the outstanding, advantages of gardening with annuals, is you really have, a lot of power, and prerogative to stick 'em wherever you want. but a tree, takes a long time to become a tree, and so, there it is... now that's some good things, about a tree. because trees take such a long time and because they can be so, majestic, and carry such a sense of history and, make such, a a basic, part of the structural... aspects of your landscape, we wanna be very, reluctant, in general, to cut down trees or remove trees, from our landscape. however, there are some reasons, why, we might want, to remove a tree, or we might want to not let a tree, get started in the wrong place, or we might wanna remove, some, of a tree. trees are very big plants, but what's particularly relevant about a tree, that we may not be fully aware of, is that trees, are often, as big or nearly as big, underground, as they are above ground. typically, trees have lots of leaf surface, especially compared to, a little piney plant, and most plants, that have lots of leaf surface, evaporate lots of, <U WHO="SU-f"> water </U> water. so a big tree, is able to, suck lots of water, out of the ground, all around it. typically, the roots of a tree, extend, outward at least as far, as the branches extend outward. so if we have a, tree growing in our garden, right underneath the tree, there's likely to be, an unfair competition for water, between the tree, and anything else, you plant there. so we need to be aware, that the tree is making a huge, demand on the water supply, and being a big powerful plant, it has the muscle, to demand quote more than its share, of water. trees' roots, start out as little, tiny things that grow at the end, and they're exploring around trying to find water and nutrients and space, and then, as they grow they get bigger, and bigger around, until pretty soon, they're bigger around than they were before. now ordinarily this is a good thing. but if the tree finds the foundation of your house, and puts some of its little roots in there, and then later they get bigger around, the foundation of your house begins to crumble, and that's not cool. so, we don't want trees to grow, too close, to the foundation, of our house. trees are also very good, at finding, your sewerage drains. what is there in a sewerage drain that a tree would really like to be able to find? <U WHO="SS"> water </U> water but most especially? nutrients. nutrients. and then the tree, fills your sewage drain, full of roots, and your sewage drain doesn't drain, any more. <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> when trees are too close to your house, their branches, hang out over your roof... and perhaps they drop lots of leaves if they're a deciduous tree, on your roof... and these fill up your eaves' troughs, so the water doesn't drain off your roof anymore... or the tree reaches so far over your roof, that it gets on top of your chimney. what happens then? <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> <U WHO="SU-f"> (xx) </U> the chimney doesn't draw, the way it was designed to. the, smoke doesn't rise up out of your chimney, in accordance with the aerodynamics, that your chimney was designed, to stimulate. so your fireplace, starts to back up and fill your house full of smoke, or your furnace stops working properly. it's really important, to trim, tree branches, that have actually physically gone too close or even over, your chimney, away from your chimney. sometimes the tree branches, are very close to your roof or even, lying, down, on your roof... especially if you have asbestos shingle over plywood type roof which is quite common, in our part of the world, the tree will prevent your roof from drying out in between rain storms, and your roof will start to rot... now right next to your house, is a very common place, for trees to start to grow, ironically enough, and why is that? <PAUSE DUR=":08"/> anybody have an idea, why trees start to grow, spontaneously right where we don't want them? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> is it because there's more shelter right next to a house? </U> <U WHO="S1"> sounds like a good idea. i can't hear it though. </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> is it because there's more shelter, for the seeds? less <OVERLAP> less (xx) </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> there's </OVERLAP> more shelter of a very special kind. </U> <PAUSE DUR=":09"/> <U WHO="SU-f"> is it protection from the wind? </U> <U WHO="S1"> perhaps a little protection of the wind but i have something else in mind. </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> protected from lawn mowers? </U> <U WHO="S1"> protection from your, Jessica? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> lawn mower. </U> <U WHO="S1"> lawn mower. protection from your lawn mower. tree seedlings, really, don't like, to be (mown.) and in fact, what keeps your lawn lawn, and not, a forest, is because you mow it. if you didn't mow your lawn, come back in twenty years, it'd be covered with trees. that's because we live, in an eastern hardwood forest, where the potential, vegetation, is a hardwood forest. that means if we stop doing anything, and let nature take its course, it ultimately, reverts back to, the eastern hardwood forest. so it's a good idea, as cagey gardeners to keep our eyes out, for trees seedlings and saplings that are starting to get, so big that we're gonna feel sorry for them, and weed them right up while they're still, little and tiny, and trying to grow, next to our, house. Ailanthus trees, are particularly good at growing next to our house, if our house is built on a concrete foundation which most of us, have. because Ailanthus trees, really like the, calcium carbonate, that concrete is made out of. fact sometimes, you can, see where old homesteads, used to be, and there's nothing left except a field or maybe a few small trees, and growing mysteriously in a square that might not be otherwise explained, is a bunch of little, Ailanthus, trees of heaven. and if you go look carefully, spread the briars away, you can find, the foundations, of an old house. trees, and hedges, hedges are things that we sometimes have in our, landscape these are made of low bushes all grouped together, to look like a fence. trees and hedges, and sometimes vines, play the role, of casting, shade. we may, want the shade, we may not want the shade. we might want the shade at certain times of, year and not at other times of year. so thinking about, sun and shade, and where we want it or don't want it, when we want it, and don't want it, is an important thing for us, to be doing, as landscape gardeners. <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="ENTERS"/> hi Zeineb. <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> so here's the sun... and here's the world... <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> and here's the equator on the world, and the sun, is gonna shine, on the equator straight down, two times during the year. and what do we call these two times (of the s-) </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> spring and fall equinox </U> <U WHO="S1"> spring and, fall what? </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> solstice </U> <U WHO="S1"> equinox, spring and fall, equinox. and equinox means what? <U WHO="SS"> equal </U> equi </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> day and night </U> <U WHO="S1"> equal night, equal night night is equal to the day. and that happens, in the spring and fall. and then, in the summer. and the winter. <PAUSE DUR=":06"/> the sun goes south for the winter. smart sun. <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> so in the winter, the sun gets as far south as what? about how far south? <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> where does it go, when it goes south for the winter where does it go? <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"/> <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> where would you like to go? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> St. Martin's </U> <U WHO="S1"> <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD  THROUGHOUT NEXT :05  OF UTTERANCE"/> to the tropic... it goes, to a southern limit that we call a tropic. and, in the, summertime it goes to a northern limit that we also call a, tropic, so we have two tropics, we have the southern tropic and the northern tropic. <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> so, the difference, in the angle that the sun makes, between, the summer and the winter. <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> is about, forty-four forty-five, degrees. now, what latitude are we at here in Ann Arbor does anybody know this? </U> <U WHO="SS"> forty-five </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> forty-four degrees. </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> forty-four </U> <U WHO="S1"> about forty-four degrees. <EVENT DUR=":09" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> so. <EVENT DUR=":10" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> the angle that the sun, is going to make, when it shines down on us, is going to vary, between forty-four degrees, plus or minus, twenty-two degrees, so we're gonna have. <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> if this is our house, in the summertime... we're gonna have about a sixty-five degree angle... and in the wintertime, we're gonna have about a twenty-two degree angle, and if we have a little bit of overhang on our roof like this, in front of our big picture window, then in the winter, the sun will shine in the, window, illuminate our houseplants, and keep our house warm and sunny, and in the summertime, the sun won't shine in our window, so our house doesn't get too hot... now the same principle... applies, to, trees and hedges and houses and any other obstruction, to the sunlight, that you have in your landscape. we're gonna get, a little tiny shadow, on the north side, during what season of the year? <PAUSE DUR=":13"/> there's our, evergreen tree, i'm just gonna make a little tiny shadow, during what season of the year, and a great big shadow during what season of the year? </U> <U WHO="SS"> summer </U> <U WHO="S1"> little tiny shadow is <U WHO="SS"> summer </U> the summer shadow, and the big shadow, is the <U WHO="SS"> winter </U> winter, shadow. probably if you want this tree, for shade, that's just, backwards. right? so, shade trees, we like shade trees, to have a wide, canopy, that makes a, shadow, that's pretty much under the canopy, in the summertime, when the sun is shining, straight down. <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> here's our hedge. recall that, we have basically, two different ways, that we can, prune a hedge, and one that we call, formal, and the other one we call informal. the informal, really means, we let the hedge, take its natural, form. we let the branches, of the hedge plant, grow out, in their natural way, often making a nice, arching or flowing, um appearance, often taking up a lot more, width around our hedge plant, um than if we had cut it all back. and formal, means, that we've artificially, clipped it, into a form, that it would never take, naturally or almost never take naturally... now the tradition, of formal, gardening... might be traced, back... to ideas, that we, as Western Europeans, held in our culture, in the sixteenth and seventeenth century. John Milton's writings were, useful for codifying, these ideas recording these ideas, i, doubt seriously that he made them up he was just, writing to reflect, the cultural values, of the time. and at that time... it was important, for people, in the culture, of northwestern Europe, to believe, that human beings... were supposed to dominate, nature. they were supposed to have dominion, over nature. it was sort of our purpose nature had been put there, for us, to dominate. and the way we dominated it, in those days our concept of dominating it, was to make it, grow, in geometric, patterns that weren't, natural to us. we imposed our, geometry, onto natural plants and created formal, gardens, with formally, pruned, plants, that, demonstrated our superiority over the plants because we could clip 'em, down to look like boxes... triangles... bunny rabbits, teapots. we, really, clipped 'em all kinds of ways here. and, we still have a very strong desire many of us, to impose, our, will, over the plants, that are growing in our garden and of course, as gardeners we impose our will, we get in there and, interfere with all kinds of stuff that might otherwise go on, if we weren't participating in it. but especially in the last decade in the United States. there's been a, increased awareness, of more natural gardening, an increased willingness and interest, to do gardening that goes with the flow, rather than, tries to impose something unnatural, or do something difficult, or grow something exotic... we're much more interested now, in growing natives, in conditions that are more natural to them, and celebrating that, but that's a different subject here. we still, enjoy, in many parts, of our landscape, formal, hedges. hedges that have been cut to look like boxes. you see that all over the place. <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> now lets suppose, <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD THROUGHOUT NEXT :56 OF UTTERANCE"/> this hedge is running east and west. this is the south side, and this is the north side... and here's the sun shining... and if we cut this hedge, to look like a long skinny box... this part, of the hedge here, is gonna get a lot of sunshine, the top of the hedge, that's gonna do pretty good, but this side over here <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING ON BOARD"/> it's gonna be in the shade. and particularly, this part right down here, is gonna be in the shade. and even, this part over here on the sunny side, if we let this hedge do what it wants, which is grow out here, at the top where it gets lots of sunshine, this down here can become in the shade too if we aren't careful with that. and when this part, and this part stay in the shade for a while, what happens? well those leaves, can't pay their rent, the mean old landlord plant, evicts them, <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"/> and they fall off. so you end up with bare, sticky stems, where the plant, can't afford, to subsidize leaves, that aren't catching enough sun energy, to at least maintain themselves. now as gardeners, we think a, hedge that's got a lot of bare sticks down here at the bottom, is really beautiful right? no. so if we wanna be savvy, formal, hedge gardeners, then, we need to, give our hedge, a little bit of slope, coming down here, and especially, the north side of the hedge, we might wanna give, quite a bit of, slope, to it, um, so that, this part of the hedge, still stands a chance, of getting a little bit of light. now you can walk through the campus, here, you can take a look, through the neighborhoods and folks that have hedges, you could just look, at all these hedges, all these leggy hedges, because people don't get it. now you know how to get it, and when you grow your hedge, you'll know what to do. hedges are like, fences. what do fences do in our landscapes? fences, block, the view, so if we have a view that we wanna block, we could put up a fence, providing the view isn't, so high that putting up a fence, is not, feasible. why would we want, to block, a view? might be a view of something, really, ugly. but it might not. we might wanna block, a view, to more effectively, present, something else, in front of it. and in fact one of the really important, roles that hedges play, in our landscape, is to provide, a blank, backdrop, for something else, that we'd like to direct, our attention to or the attention of others. so if we have, a specimen, plant, th- looking very nice out there, or if we have a, perennial in the narrow sense, border and we wanna be able to see those flowers, not just disappear off against some vague, busy background, but we wanna be able to see them, with our vision stopped nicely, on a nice green hedge, then the hedge, is blocking, our view, not because there's something ugly back there, but because we want, our view directed, at something that's in front of the hedge. hedges and fences are also useful, for dividing your landscape, into, areas that give us, a sense, of rooms. now we may recall, that one of the, ideas, that's come to characterize our approach to home landscape, in the latter part of this century, is the idea that, our landscape, becomes an extension, of our home, outdoors. so as we extend our home outdoors, the feeling that we're, in outdoor rooms, can be very effective. so sometimes, we can use hedges or fences, to break up, the, space in our garden, into more, complex, spatial structures, into places where, we feel like we're, in a particular spot, devoted to a particular thing. the fences can also, block, wind, can block, light and cast shade if that's what we're, looking for, although usually when we want shade, it's the summertime and, we get better shade from, up top than we do from a fence. the fence might, block animals, or people. very often, our fences, are on our property lines. when we put up a fence, on a property line, it affects not only, what's going on in our landscape, it affects, what's going on, in the landscape of your neighbor. you think your neighbor might be interested, in his or her landscape? is that likely? mm. likely. so when we put up a fence, or when we wanna put up a fence, on our property line, what would be a very good idea? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> ask his advice </U> <U WHO="S1"> talk to your neighbor, about it. in fact, getting along with your neighbor, having neighbors you get along with, being able to figure out how to behave yourself in such a way that you do get along with your neighbor, adds enormous, value, to your, landscape, because it enables you, to enjoy your landscape, with a feeling, that you're, among neighbors that you can get along with rather than that you're some kind of, entrenched fort in hostile enemy territory. now, Americans in the last, several decades, haven't put getting along with their neighbor, in a very high priority. we tend to be more concerned with our, privacy, than with our, ability, to get along, with each other. there's kind of an irony in this, because, so many of us now, live in, suburbia, which is that form of, housing, where we've got about, six houses to a, what did we call that plot of land? <U WHO="SU-f"> acre </U> acre. acre is how much land it takes to build six houses, in suburbia. that's how we can define, an acre. we we grow, we we live in houses, that are separate, with yards around them, but they're basically still, pretty close to each other. now the reality is, you'd have more, real privacy, if you lived in an apartment building, in a city, or if you went right out there, and lived in a little farmhouse, in the country, on, a thousand-acre farm where there wasn't any, any house anywhere around. that you know, privacy is the name of the game. those are the real options there. so in many senses suburbia, is one of the worst choices we could make, if what we really want, is privacy. what we really want, is community. so, there are some important things, that we need to bear in mind... when we think about, our suburban landscape. one of them is, although, we don't want, our neighbors, looking in our bathroom window <EVENT WHO="SU-m" DESC="LAUGH"/> and so on you know there are limits, that a primary goal for our landscape is not, to create or preserve or maintain, privacy, although, you know there there're some, limits that we wanna do here, um that's not the dominant goal. the dominant goal, is to provide, an environment outside, of our house that we can use, in ways that are meaningful to us, much the way, we use the inside of our house. so there are some, big time no-nos, that we wanna bear in mind, when we're looking at our landscape, design. lights in our, landscape, are for safety, hm? so they illuminate, your feet where you walk. a very good light for illuminating, your feet where you walk is one that's right down close to the ground, and can illuminate, where you're walking. that way it doesn't shine in your eyes so you still have good night vision, but it shines on the ground where your feet are going. that site of light is also excellent, because another reason to have lights, is for their aesthetic appeal. and of course the real model, for totally aesthetic, lighting at night is what kind of lighting...? <SEG TYPE="SINGING"> by the light </SEG> <U WHO="SU-f"> the moon. </U> the moonlight right? <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> so we're mimicking, moonlight. we wanna have subtle, light that doesn't blast in our eyes, illuminates what we need. we may also, want lights, to illuminate, outside activities if we are, serving a meal, on our patio at night, we may need a light so our guests don't, fall over their food. we may also wanna put a light, on our property, that will help burglars see better when they're trying to break into our house <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> some people like to do that. they're considerate. what we don't want to do, is mount the lights, on our house and shine them, on our neighbor's house a really hostile, thoughtless, activity, that's absolutely de rigueur, in American suburbia. and similarly, sound. one man's music is another man's noise, so, if you wanna hear sound in your yard, put your speakers away from your patio or away from your house, aim 'em towards your own house, and then you can have your sound levels much lower, still enjoy them and hear them, and your neighbors hear them much less. you know and of course the barking dog, thing, you know. if you really wanna have a barking dog, in your yard, having your yard in suburbia, is not, a friendly, cooperative thing, to do. so let's just bear in mind as we, evaluate and admire our landscapes, we're there, with a community of people, that we really wanna, enjoy, and live happily together with, and that's an important part, of designing our landscapes. please pick up your lecture quizzes, from your G-S-I, on your way out, and i hope everybody has a great, spring break. </U> <P> {END OF TRANSCRIPT} </P> </BODY> </TEXT> </TEI.2>
