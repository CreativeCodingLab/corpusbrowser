Thursday you'll have another quiz okay? we wouldn't wanna let you uh, sleep or anything. and that will be over what he does next which, i believe is transcription and translation and will, also be over the Sordaria lab. and today, um we're gonna end with a quiz so you guys will have a chance to ask any questions that you might have and i'm ending with the quiz because, we're gonna do the chromosome dance which i think will help you, for the quiz, prior to that hopefully. but, uh before that, i wanna go over a couple things that you need, before, we actually, start the chromosome dance. and that, involves genetic recombination, and what does recombination mean? if i say, there's recombination, Meagan? </U> <U WHO="S2"> isn't that when the chromosomes overlap? </U> <U WHO="S1"> could be that's called what? </U> <U WHO="SS"> crossing over </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay, crossing over. and when does that occur? </U> <U WHO="SS"> meiosis. </U> <U WHO="S1"> which phase? </U> <U WHO="SS"> <OVERLAP> prophase. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> prophase one. </OVERLAP> okay. so you could get crossing over and that would lead to recombination. can you think of another way you can get recombination? something that's not like the parent. </U> <U WHO="S2"> mutations? </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay mutation. but something naturally occurring with the chromosomes. </U> <U WHO="S3"> a mixture of the, paternal, per- paternal, genes. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay, good. uh i just wanna illustrate that for you. i'll use the same alleles that we used, on Tuesday. <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD THROUGHOUT UTTERANCE"/> and let me just say, we've got dad here. and you had, A and B. okay? so i'll just say he's big-A, big-B... let's draw it small. and he mates with mom, who's little-A little-B. okay, these are unreplicated chromosomes or unduplicated. which means they're probably in G-one, they need to go through the S-phase. fertilization occurs. okay and they'll be brought together. and, it's just random, where they're gonna go, okay at this point. because they're unduplicated. okay? once they duplicate, if we're talking about meiosis what happens? okay if they're duplicated, what happens next? in prophase one? </U> <U WHO="S4"> pairing <OVERLAP> of the chromosomes. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> mkay. </OVERLAP> homologous chromosomes are going to pair so, i'll just draw them paired <EVENT DUR=":15" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> okay? and this is just one option, of the way they could be paired. and what i'm trying to show you is that, genetic recombination can occur, through something called independent assortment. <EVENT DUR=":12" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> and that's just a fancy way of saying, random, alignment of chromosomes, at metaphase okay? <EVENT DUR=":07" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> and you should be able to follow this through. if this was, call it, metaphase one, picture anaphase one okay? and you get a cell, and telophase cytokinesis one you'd get a cell with big-A big-B. and you'd have another daughter cell with little-A little-B. if you can follow that through, post-meiosis two, <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"/> okay you should realize that you get four daughter cells, okay that, one would have a big-A big-B, so would the other. and then you'd have two daughter cells that just had little-A little-B in 'em... this is after meiosis two, and, what do you notice about the way they look? these daughter cells. </U> <U WHO="S5"> hap- haploid appearance </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay they're haploid. that was right. and they also look like, the parents, the original, parents. and we call these parentals, for obvious reasons okay. <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"/> we just get, A B like dad, little-A little-B like mom. so these are called parentals... and there's been no recombination there okay? but equally likely, since this is just the nucleoplasm and these, things are floating around, you could've had, big-A assort with little-B. okay or vice versa. <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> ahh <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> so now post-meiosis two, you'd get something quite different, you'd have a cell with big-A little-B, <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> and little-A big-B... okay. and they look, different from the, parents okay? you could, assign any traits you wanted. but they don't look like either parent and for that reason they're called, recombinants. <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> okay? so, you guys should understand the distinction first of all understand why this is random, okay? just random alignment in this fluid the nucleoplasm, that can't distinguish, who's lining up with who okay? if, independent assortment occurs, it's just as likely that you're gonna get, the same number of parentals as recombinants. okay? why, why do we want recombinants? why is that important? why do we care? </U> <U WHO="SS"> variation </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay, variation and that'll become important for evolution down the road. okay? okay. so that's independent assortment, understand that you can get, recombination through independent assortment. um, alternatively, we could show crossing over okay? and what that would look like, is let's say, you had a, reciprocal exchange between, the A gene on, chromatids two and three okay? what that would look like, <EVENT DUR=":06" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> would be something like this... Bs, were not involved so they stay the same. <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> and you should be able to follow this through and see, why you wouldn't get, all parentals here. okay so after meiosis two just picture this, you'd end up with four daughter cells <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> one with big-A big-B, little-A big-B, big-A little-B, and little-A little-B, okay. and this would be a parental type. these two would be, recombinants, and that would be a parental. okay. <PAUSE DUR=":07"/> if, crossing over occurs, it doesn't occur all the time, okay? and it h- so far we've just drawn one gene on a chromosome but there are hundreds. so you could picture a crossover at any locus, mkay? it may happen at one locus and not another. so with, crossing over you always get fewer recombinants than you do parentals. okay? with independent assortment it's a fifty-fifty, balance... okay, um any questions on that? this is gonna be real important next week when you start to do genetics problems. okay? <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> good? okay. uh, one last thing before we actually, fill in a table that we're gonna, go around the room and discuss. um, sometimes there're errors that occur in meiosis particularly meiosis one okay? and, those errors, may, happen, early, late metaphase. um more particularly anaphase one. okay, when, the chromosomes are supposed to separate, and maybe they don't okay? so if, <EVENT DUR=":04" DESC="PAUSE WHILE ERASING"/> there's an error, <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> in meiosis, and i'll just put it in parentheses cuz it's most common in anaphase one... this is called nondisjunction and what it means, is the chromosomes don't separate properly okay? and, nondisjunction the reason i bring this up is because uh there's a table in your book we're gonna fill out next that, mentions nondisjunction. it's most common in meiosis one anaphase one <EVENT DUR=":05" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> and what that might look like, is let's just say, it's time for anaphase one to occur. you're used to, one A chromosome going, in one direction, the other, the other direction. let's just say, an error occurs. and both As, go to the left side of my cell, and no As go to the right. okay, so, i'd end up, with cells... after, telophase one, that were diploid for the A allele. <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> okay so this cell would be diploid for the A allele and you know that's, not what usually happens okay? and this cell would have no A allele. that's called nondisjunction, this cell would die, this cell this cell could persist imagine this being, haploid, okay, undergoing a second meiosis, maybe this is an egg. sperm fertilizes it, dad gives his copy of A, to the egg, and his copy of B, and now, you have a trisomy. mkay? um, you have three copies, of the A chromosome, and many times that's fatal. okay? uh in human situations that's how Down's syndrome comes about. we have three copies, of, the chromosome twenty-one. and those individuals tend to be fine. um, the other two chromosomes thirteen and eighteen that this, more, frequently happens to, those individuals tend, most of them will die before puberty mkay. so, this is nondisjunction, and typically it occurs, during meiosis one. mkay... okay. um before we do, the chromosome dance, in your coursepacks, there's a table <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> that, i'd like you to fill out. um we've already talked, quite extensively about the difference between mitosis meiosis one and meiosis two, now without looking, at your notes, and this should help pretty, extensively for the quiz too. just try to fill in the table. and we'll go around the room, and see how you did. yeah Bryant. </U> <U WHO="S6"> do you happen to have any copies of that? </U> <U WHO="S1"> no i'll go, i'll go get one though. cuz mine's, mine's filled in and that would be cheating. um, so try to fill these out. i'll go get you a copy and, we'll go around the room. and what i want_ how i want this to run is, let's say Joel says generates two diploid cells from a diploid. and he says meiosis one if that's wrong jump on him, okay and tell him why that's wrong okay? and, you guys, figure it out and let, each other know what's wrong versus me telling you. okay. so try that. i'll be right back. i don't' know if you wanna pause it or not. </U> <EVENT DUR="2:24" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WORKING"/> <U WHO="S1"> somebody's in the lost and found. <U WHO="S6"> okay </U> it's old though. </U> <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> <U WHO="S6"> so it's okay if i write on it? </U> <U WHO="S1"> yeah it's from last semester so i don't think they're gonna come back. </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> mhm </U> <U WHO="S6"> is it the same thing? <U WHO="S1"> hm? </U> are there any differences? </U> <U WHO="S1"> no, no. </U> <U WHO="S5"> i don't have my book either. </U> <U WHO="S1"> you don't. <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> alright. <PAUSE DUR=":06"/> let me steal this for one second and make a copy. </U> <U WHO="S7"> you can make two. </U> <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> <U WHO="S1"> this is discussion you guys you're supposed to have this. </U> <U WHO="S6"> somebody stole mine you have no excuse. <U WHO="S8"> i don't even know <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> </U> someone stole mine you just left yours at home. </U> <U WHO="S8"> i don't even remember (xx) </U> <U WHO="S6"> i don't care. you're supposed to be prepared for class each and every day. what happened to the (xx) <OVERLAP> alright. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S8"> <OVERLAP> i don't think it's that good because (i don't even them </OVERLAP> i don't even have a word.) </U> <EVENT DUR=":40" DESC="UNINTELLIGIBLE SPEECH"/> <U WHO="S1"> okay who else...? actually just use this and you can just write in the book. </U> <U WHO="S8"> thanks. </U> <EVENT DUR="4:00" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WORKING"/> <U WHO="S1"> that's just, cuz there're hardly any men in here. <EVENT WHO="SU-f" DESC="LAUGH"/> </U> <EVENT DUR=":32" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WORKING"/> <U WHO="S1"> you guys ready? <U WHO="SU-f"> yeah </U> yeah? </U> <U WHO="SS"> yes </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay. how about if we start with Erin, and just go, around the room, read your question and then, say what you think. and if you think Erin's wrong or, anyone's wrong, um, tell 'em. </U> <U WHO="S8"> i got a question real quick. can it be um, more than, <U WHO="S1"> yeah </U> one <U WHO="S1"> yeah </U> okay. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay? </U> <U WHO="S9"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> generates two diploid cells from a diploid cell. </SEG> i put mitosis. and, after she asked that question i'm thinking, meiosis two, because it's the same as mitosis. </U> <U WHO="S1"> what do you start with though, in meiosis two? </U> <U WHO="S9"> haploid. </U> <U WHO="S1"> right. mkay so you, end with haploids too. so, just mitosis. everybody, agree on that? </U> <U WHO="S5"> mhm </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay so remember, you have to start out diploid in meiosis, but after meiosis one you have two daughter cells that're haploid already. mkay? those two daughter cells, undergo a further reduction division to produce four haploids. okay? </U> <U WHO="S12"> uh- <SEG TYPE="READING"> generates two haploid cells from a diploid </SEG> meiosis one. i don't, nope. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay she sounds confident. <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> is that your final answer? </U> <U WHO="SS"> yeah </U> <U WHO="S1"> uh everybody agree? </U> <U WHO="S4"> no </U> <U WHO="S9"> i put meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> no? okay somebody thinks it's also meiosis two? </U> <U WHO="SS"> no </U> <U WHO="S4"> no, (that creates) four. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay Maria's right. um, you get two haploid cells from a diploid cell. why isn't it, meiosis two? </U> <U WHO="S4"> you get four </U> <U WHO="S1"> and what do you start with? </U> <U WHO="S4"> haploid. </U> <U WHO="SS"> haploid </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay you start with a haploid. remember, it's diploid at the beginning, then haploid haploid. mkay? so it's just meiosis one. </U> <U WHO="S13"> um, <SEG TYPE="READING"> generates two haploid cells from a haploid cell. </SEG> meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay, everybody agree with that? </U> <U WHO="S9"> mitosis </U> <U WHO="S3"> mitosis. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay mitosis. remember that haploids can undergo mitosis as well so don't forget that, you start out haploid you make two haploids. and, you have <OVERLAP> drawings, </OVERLAP> <U WHO="S13"> <OVERLAP> is it both or </OVERLAP> just </U> sorry? </U> <U WHO="S13"> is it both of 'em or just mitosis? </U> <U WHO="S1"> uh both of them. mitosis and meiosis two... yep? </U> <U WHO="S2"> so like, how would, if by mitosis, which kind of cells like wouldn't be the diploid cuz you know how, like how could it be a diploid anyhow, for mitosis? </U> <U WHO="S1"> um, okay remember the, the drawings that i gave? let's just say_ i'll just use, two alleles. </U> <U WHO="S2"> well like for, uh um, prokaryote it would be like two haploid cells right? where, it just, the difference from like, </U> <U WHO="S1"> i- yeah it doesn't necessarily have to be prokaryotic, on fungus, there are many fungus that are haploid all their lives, like Sordaria is. but if you picture_ okay this is a haploid let's just say it has one chromosome, okay. and it can, go through, mitosis. <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"/> and there's metaphase it's lined up, okay here's anaphase, mkay, and then telophase cytokineses would produce two haploids. <U WHO="S2"> mhm </U> okay? so any ploidy can undergo mitosis. it's meiosis that you need the homologous, pairing on multiple of two. </U> <U WHO="S9"> is that for one and two? </U> <U WHO="S1"> sorry? </U> <U WHO="S9"> is that for one and two, just haploid, for meiosis one and two? </U> <U WHO="S1"> um well thi- this was, wait where are we here? two haploids from a haploid. so that's mitosis and meiosis two. okay? okay. </U> <U WHO="S5"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> homologous chromosomes separate during anaphase, </SEG> i put meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> anybody agree, disagree? </U> <U WHO="S4"> disagree </U> <U WHO="SS"> disagree </U> <U WHO="S1"> disagree why? </U> <U WHO="SS"> meiosis one. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay meiosis one. you don't have homologous chromosomes at meiosis two anymore remember because the homologues have separated out, and meiosis two is similar to mitosis. mkay? so the, homologues don't pair anymore. so it's just meiosis one. </U> <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> <U WHO="S2"> um, <SEG TYPE="READING"> sister chromatids separate during anaphase </SEG> meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay anybody wanna add anything to that? </U> <U WHO="SS"> mitosis </U> <U WHO="S1"> mitosis. okay. so remember sister chromatids will g- separate, during anaphase. they won't, during meiosis one anaphase one, okay? but they do, in meiosis two anaphase two. </U> <U WHO="S14"> okay um, <SEG TYPE="READING"> sister chromatids are not necessarily identical </SEG> um, i put meiosis, one? and two? </U> <U WHO="S1"> and why might they not be identical? </U> <U WHO="S14"> um cuz they might have different alleles. </U> <U WHO="S1"> from how? </U> <U WHO="S14"> crossing over </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay. good. everybody agree with that? meiosis one and meiosis two you might have, nonidentical, Katrina? </U> <U WHO="S5"> when does crossing over occur? </U> <U WHO="S1"> prophase one meiosis one. mkay? </U> <U WHO="S8"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> sister chromatids are identical. </SEG> uh mitosis and meiosis one. </U> <U WHO="S1"> uh, um yeah they they could be iden- if no crossing over occurs sure, they could be identical i- i mean, i- actually it could be all three, as long as no crossing over no recombination occurs. but you know they're identical, absolutely in mitosis for sure. okay there's never any crossing over in mitosis. <U WHO="S8"> okay. </U> so that's, that's kind of an arbitrary. okay. </U> <U WHO="S15"> um, <SEG TYPE="READING"> D-N-A replicates prior to prophase. </SEG> i put mitosis and meiosis one. </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay. everybody agree with that? that you have, replication the S-phase prior to mitosis and meiosis one. </U> <U WHO="S13"> no. why's this? why isn't it in mitosis, i mean (meiosis two?) </U> <U WHO="S1"> why what? why not be be, okay think of what you end up with after meiosis, one. you end up with, haploids. <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"/> but they're duplicated already right? they're still duplicated because the centromere has not divided. <U WHO="SU-f"> mitosis and meiosis one </U> mkay so, they wouldn't duplicate again. you're trying to reduce the amount of genetic information, during meiosis two. okay and that is what happens. </U> <U WHO="S13"> so, the answer is, mitosis and meiosis one? </U> <U WHO="S1"> right. </U> <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> <U WHO="S6"> oh okay uh, <SEG TYPE="READING"> D-N-A does not replicate prior to, prophase. </SEG> i just have meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay. is there anybody, disagree? wants to admit it? no? okay. </U> <U WHO="S4"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> crossing over, can occur </SEG> i put meiosis one and two. actually, </U> <U WHO="S1"> wanna take something back? </U> <U WHO="S4"> um, not meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay, yeah just meiosis one. why can't it occur, during meiosis two? </U> <U WHO="S11"> cuz they don't have homologous chromosomes. </U> <U WHO="S1"> right, there's only one copy they're haploid then there's no ho- homologue to, pair with and cross with okay. </U> <U WHO="S11"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> nondisjunction can occur, </SEG> i put um meiosis one. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay. nobody would disagree with that right since you just learned about nondisjunction, <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> a moot point </U> <U WHO="S16"> uh <SEG TYPE="READING"> centromeres divide, </SEG> i put, mitosis, and i think, does that happen in meiosis two? <U WHO="S1"> yeah </U> that's what i put <U WHO="S1"> yeah </U> but i wasn't sure. </U> <U WHO="S1"> does everybody like that? </U> <U WHO="S6"> centromeres don't (divide?) </U> <U WHO="S1"> no, centromeres don't divide remember? why don't they? </U> <U WHO="S5"> cuz isn't it the whole chromosome though? </U> <U WHO="S1"> why? </U> <U WHO="S9"> spindle attached to the wrong side. </U> <U WHO="S1"> right, the spindle fiber's only attached on one side of the chromosome, whoever, asked that, so they can't it just pulls, one chromosome that way and one, the other way. unless, nondisjunction occurs okay? </U> <U WHO="S17"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> individual chromosomes align at equatorial plate during metaphase. </SEG> um i said mitosis and meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay. both with mitosis and meiosis one because they're l- i'm sorry two because they're lining up, single file. </U> <U WHO="S18"> um, <SEG TYPE="READING"> homologous pairs of chromosomes align, at the equatorial plate during metaphase, </SEG> meiosis one. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay. everybody agree with that? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> mhm </U> <U WHO="S1"> Rebecca. </U> <U WHO="S19"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> um occurs in sematic cells </SEG> uh, mitosis? </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay sematic cells is mitosis. so, sex cells whoa. </U> <U WHO="S20"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> occurs in sex cells, </SEG> meiosis one and meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay, meiosis one and two, are for sex cells. </U> <U WHO="S10"> <SEG TYPE="READING"> produces two daughter cells that are genen- genetically identical, to each other and to, the parent, cell. </SEG> mitosis and meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> and what? </U> <U WHO="S10"> meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> we're talking the, the very original parent. <U WHO="S21"> (mhm) </U> so, how does the original parent start out? in meiosis? what's its ploidy? </U> <U WHO="S10"> meiosis is, haploid. right? <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> (xx) </U> <U WHO="S1"> anyone wanna help her out? meiosis has to start out diploid why? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> mm so it can breed and cover one another </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> because it can't replicate within meiosis. </U> <U WHO="S1"> right you have to have a homologous pair, okay? so you have to have two of each, so you have to at least have some, i don't know some, uh multiple, of two. so, i'm just trying to get to the final answer, why, why it's not meiosis two. if it starts out diploid what're your four products of meiosis? what's the pro- the ploidy of your four, end products of meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="SS"> they're haploid </U> <U WHO="S1"> they're haploid right. so can they be identical to the, original parent? no. they <OVERLAP> have half the genetic </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S10"> <OVERLAP> i thought that they meant </OVERLAP> the original original. <OVERLAP> like the </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> they do, </OVERLAP> and the original original, is diploid. <U WHO="S10"> okay </U> and and so the, progeny of the gametes have half the genetic information as the, as the parent. </U> <U WHO="S21"> um, <SEG TYPE="READING"> produces two daughter cells, that're not genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell. </SEG> meiosis one and meiosis two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay? everybody agree? okay. i <OVERLAP> think it </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S5"> <OVERLAP> do cells </OVERLAP> either have to like, go through mitosis or meiosis one and two? </U> <U WHO="S1"> yeah, if you're a germ cell and you're gonna become a sex cell, you undergo meiosis. mkay, if you're another type of cell in the body you undergo mitosis. </U> <U WHO="S5"> right so they never go through, like all three. </U> <U WHO="S1"> um actually germ cells do. li- okay picture this. a sperm and an egg, come together fertilization occurs, you have a single, diploid zygote okay it's a single cell, it's diploid. somehow you have to, grow into a multi-cellular being, that includes the germ cells. so mitosis occurs in each of, you know skin cells nerve cells germ cells. and the germ cells s- starts out diploid. okay? and then when it's going to become a sperm or an egg, it goes through meiosis. but the germ cell's the only one that will go through both. okay we don't wanna leave you guys out. um, Katrina, why is it important to, <U WHO="S10"> oh my, </U> ensure constancy in meio- mitosis m- mitosis, produces constant, cell line, identical cells why would that be important? </U> <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> <U WHO="S5"> i don't understand the question. </U> <U WHO="S1"> um, it's right there, the crucial difference between mitosis and meiosis, is encapsulated by the statement mitosis is a mechanism for constancy okay? so, if you have a liver cell, why is it important to make more, liver cells? why do you want, identical, an identical clone of cells? </U> <PAUSE DUR=":04"/> <U WHO="S5"> um <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> because if it's the, liver cell you want more, uh, you wouldn't want, it to be like... i don't know. </U> <U WHO="S1"> anyone wanna help?

Bridget's saying for regeneration obviously if you want a skin cell you want that same clone of skin cells you, you don't want it mutated so it's an abnormal skin cell. um you don't want a liver cell growing in place of it so you wanna turn genes on, that're going to express liver, proteins or whatever to make a liver cell, and turn those off that don't mkay? versus, Rasheda, why would you want, diversity in meiosis? why is diversity so important? </U> <U WHO="S22"> for when you go, later on down, with it n- the gene- uh, it'll become, it'll be more important later on down the, <U WHO="S3"> evolution </U> to, <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay, so, for evolutionary purposes right. if everything was the same, there'd be nothing for natural selection to act on, okay? um, and we're gonna, start getting into, natural selection, pretty soon, pretty much after exam number two mkay? okay Joel. does chance play a role in either mitosis or meiosis? </U> <U WHO="S3"> meiosis. </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay. and, how? how is there chance? </U> <U WHO="S3"> recombination, crossing over nondisjunction. </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay? crossing over nondisjunction or just independent assortment. just the random role of about lining up chromosomes mkay during, metaphase. okay, um this is a real good test for you guys to take again and, like right before the exam, it should_ if you can just answer these questions cold and don't have to, to look up in your notes, you should be pretty well prepared for the exam as long a- as you can draw things, mkay? um, okay, hopefully this will help with the quiz as well this little chromosome dance simulation. um, basically this is set up to illustrate, human chromosomes. you guys are gonna be human chromosomes we're gonna start with four unreplicated, human chromosomes, and then, you're gonna duplicate yourselves, mkay? and, i've got some alleles here. being sort of sex biased, i have big-B, being bad breath little-B being fresh. big-C being crabby, little-C being cheerful. and, i don't need four, men with bad breath, that're crabby. but, my, male, sperm, is going to carry an allele for bad breath, and a and a separate allele, for the crabby gene mkay? notice that these are unduplicated chromosomes at the time. and also notice, that, fertilization's going to occur, you guys should be able to take these chromosomes through, both mitosis and meiosis and understand what happens so it's going to be up to the, individual alleles to move the way you should. and the rest of you watch the way they're moving, and if they're doing something wrong let 'em know. mkay. alright. um, throughout_ first we're gonna do mitosis which is, is pretty easy, and then we'll, go to meiosis so, what i need, is four volunteers i need, bad breath, mkay who wants to, be the bad breath allele? <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> don't all stand at once right? bad breath and crabby i need one of each. c'mon... okay, Erin? which do you prefer? </U> <U WHO="S9"> crabby, </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay stand up please. okay the hands are gonna represent, chromatids and, these sticky notes don't stick too well but, here's her crabby allele, okay. whose got bad breath? besides me because i had onions for lunch. okay... bad breath. uh who wants to be cheerful? nobody? <U WHO="SU-m"> man </U> <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> and, cheerful? </U> <U WHO="S4"> i will be, </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay.

so i have the breath gene, whether it's bad or good. and have i- the mood gene whether it's bad or good those are homologues. okay so cheerful is paired with crabby, fresh is paired with bad, okay? now, typically you guys are so close together, that there's h- you can't even distinguish between, the four of you. i won't make you do that yet. <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> um, okay. so, prophase one, you're paired. get into metaphase one please. <PAUSE DUR=":08"/> <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> okay, is this good? <U WHO="SS"> yes. </U> very good okay, the homologous pairs have lined up, where are my spindle fibers? there would be a spindle fiber here on Natasha's arm, and here on Naomi's arm. and poor Felicia and Loretta have no spindle fibers so therefore, they can't_ they're just very close together. and they're not gonna be pulled apart, from their partner ultimately. </U> <U WHO="S8"> i got a question. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay. mhm </U> <U WHO="S8"> she wouldn't have a spindle fiber, just </U> <U WHO="S1"> oh Bridget does too. yeah i was just using the front row. yeah Bridget would have one, and Joel would have one but in between poor Jerry, Bryant no. okay. okay so anaphase one. okay, since these four had no spindle fiber, </U> <U WHO="S7"> are we staying? i mean i'll stay but you know </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> in the middle don't they stay? </U> <U WHO="SS"> no </U> <U WHO="S6"> <OVERLAP> no they stayed but don't they </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> no you you guys </OVERLAP> are going <U WHO="S6"> oh okay </U> to opposite poles okay. but you can't detach because you had, the four of you, had no spindle fiber that's very sad so you have to go with your, your neighbor okay. </U> <U WHO="S6"> and that's because of the, what's that? <U WHO="S3"> spindle fiber, </U> like, i can't even remember what the thing is called. <U WHO="S1"> spindle fiber? </U> no co- </U> <U WHO="S3"> kinetochore. </U> <U WHO="S6"> no kinetochore. </U> <U WHO="S1"> oh you, you have a kinetochore. </U> <U WHO="S6"> but, it's on his side though. </U> <U WHO="S1"> no your kinetochore is here. <OVERLAP> it's it's over here </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S6"> <OVERLAP> so, it's still </OVERLAP> it's still going through like my side too. like it's going through, like the spindle fiber is not, staying in his side it's like going all the way through. </U> <U WHO="S1"> it it can't it's, just staying on his side yeah cuz you guys were so close together that there's no room for <OVERLAP> it to get in there. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S6"> <OVERLAP> but the centromeres </OVERLAP> haven't dissolved yet. is is that what it is? <U WHO="S1"> right </U> okay <U WHO="S1"> right. </U> </U> <U WHO="S1"> centromeres haven't divided <U WHO="S6"> okay </U> that's why you're still attached. </U> <U WHO="S5"> so like the centromeres are even attached to the kinetochores on, each chromosome <U WHO="S1"> right </U> it's just the proteins right? </U> <U WHO="S1"> right. yep. everybody has a kinetochore. that's not the problem, okay the problem is the spindle fiber attachment. okay, so, meiosis one would occur, be over. telophase, one cytokinesis one and you'd end up with two daughter cells. how do they look? those daughter cells? what alleles do you guys have? </U> <U WHO="S6"> identical to their parents. </U> <U WHO="S1"> oh you guys ended up identical but it didn't have to be that way did it? </U> <U WHO="SS"> uh'uh, no </U> <U WHO="S1"> no cuz Brian and Joel could've been over here, Jerry and Bridget could've been over there and then they would look, recombinant right? what's their ploidy? </U> <U WHO="S6"> two-Ns </U> <U WHO="SS"> two-N </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> four-N equals eight </U> <U WHO="S1"> ahh. </U> <U WHO="SS"> no, two-N </U> <U WHO="S4"> what is_ whose, ploidy? this whole cell like this? </U> <U WHO="S1"> this whole cell and this whole cell. </U> <U WHO="SS"> two-N equals four. </U> <U WHO="S3"> two, one-N </U> <U WHO="S4"> is that one-N equals two? </U> <U WHO="S1"> how many, mood genes, mood, chromosomes do you have? </U> <U WHO="SS"> one </U> <U WHO="S1"> how many, breath chromosomes do you have? </U> <U WHO="S4"> oh i keep thinking it's_ oh i know what you're talking about now. </U> <U WHO="S5"> so one-N equals two? </U> <U WHO="S1"> one-N equals two. and that's because the centromere didn't divide, <U WHO="S4"> yeah i forget. </U> these are still duplicated to chromosomes okay? so don't forget that you start out diploid after meiosis one, you're two haploids, mkay? now you guys need to go through, meiosis two. and so get in, prophase two. uh you are okay. metaphase two... anaphase two. <U WHO="SU-f"> separate </U> okay. cytokinesis telophase two. now we have four daughter cells, that look how? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> different? </U> <U WHO="S1"> different, because they have half the genetic information as the original unreplicated parent, and it just so happens that they all lined up together so we don't really have any, recombinants per se here but we could've because it's random, okay? now if you'll just get back together with your, homologue one more time i'm just wanna show, crossing over. get back where, metaphase one. okay now i want just Jerry and Bryant, to cross over so just, swap tags. yeah or swap sides whichever you wanna do. </U> <U WHO="S6"> what're you gonna do man? </U> <U WHO="S7"> God, it's not that hard. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay, um, anaphase one... okay, cytokinesis you're, haploid. okay, now just go through meiosis two show me, the end products of meiosis two. okay good. now Natasha and Joel have bad breath and they're crabby. mkay. that looked just like dad, right? mkay, um, Loretta has bad breath, but Bryant's cheerful. is that parental or, recombinant? </U> <U WHO="SS"> recombinant. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay that's recombinant, mkay? Felicia has, fresh breath, Jerry's crabby, parental or recombinant? </U> <U WHO="SS"> recombinant. </U> <U WHO="S1"> recombinant. and then Bridget's, cheerful, and, Naomi's got fresh breath so, those were parental. okay? i think you can visualize what would happen with nondisjunction. okay? if you'll all get back together one more time with your homologues. okay, nondisjunction, we're gonna have, Brian and Jerry separate but we're gonna have Felicia and Naomi come over here. okay? okay. so now, poor, Jerry and Bridget are gonna die because they are gonna be <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> in a cell, with just one chromosome and they're missing the entire, second chromosome that they need with all the proteins. okay? </U> <U WHO="S3"> but we have Down's syndrome <EVENT WHO="SS" DESC="LAUGH"/> </U> <U WHO="S1"> but that's okay. um, so these guys, fertilization's going to occur, right? we'll just call you an egg, fertilization's going to occur. and now i have, bad breath. okay? so there's three of us, and my homologue does too. now we have three, alleles for bad breath, and, therefore it's called a trisomy for three. and, that's not too devastating we just go with, bad breath for the rest of our lives okay? but that's nondisjunction where somebody ends up with none. okay and somebody ends up with, one. </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> does it matter that he's still um, i mean, like had a crossover? </U> <U WHO="S1"> no. no that's fine. you can have, you know nondisjunction with crossing over, whatever. okay thank you chromosomes you did an excellent job so, hopefully try to visualize that cuz you guys seem to know what you're doing. and if you can visualize what's supposed to be happening that's sometimes helpful for, the exam. but first for the quiz, okay? you know what's on it. there's all the uh, cricket lab, cricket lab's on it um, D-N-A replication Meselson-Stahl the experiments where she chased Avery-Griffith mitosis meiosis. </U> <U WHO="S2"> um, what's the ploidy af- after meiosis, one? </U> <U WHO="S1"> what's what? </U> <U WHO="S2"> the, ploidy after meiosis one? </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay after meiosis one, what is the ploidy? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> one-N equals, </U> <U WHO="SU-m"> eight </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> one-N equals thirty </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay... uh the question is what's the ploidy after meiosis one? </U> <U WHO="SS"> one-N equals two. </U> <U WHO="S1"> one-N could've equal any, one-N could equal ten. <U WHO="SU-f"> oh okay. </U> okay? um, sperm cells one-N equals twenty-three in humans. okay there're twenty-three different chromosomes in the sperm but there's only one copy of each, okay? so, you started out with forty-six, and after meiosis one, you have two daughter cells that each have twenty-three, different chromosomes. </U> <U WHO="S3"> how many genes are on one, chromosome? </U> <U WHO="S1"> typically about a hundred. mkay and that's sort of a ball, hundred hundred and fifty, that's kind of a ball park, figure for how many genes are on chromosome. yeah and, and one thing we've done is we've just done unlinked genes, but keep in mind you could have A-B-C-D, that're all linked, and crossing could occur at any point, on the, chromatids. so, you may see crossing over with respect to one locus but not the other, twenty-three. mkay. </U> <U WHO="S5"> so then N represents the copy of each, chromatid? </U> <U WHO="S1"> chromosome. </U> <U WHO="S5"> chromosome. </U> <U WHO="S1"> yeah. don't even use chromatids in this class cuz it'll, confuse you i think more than anything. just know, this a, chromosome, that's unreplicated, this is a chromosome, that is replicated. </U> <U WHO="S5"> okay. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay. Meagan? </U> <U WHO="S2"> so when we're doing the, the diploid, then, or like just whatever the ploidy, you go by the letters like, so if it's A and A, even whether they're large or small then that's considered like, one kind. <U WHO="S1"> right. </U> and that so then like, if you have say you have one chromosome, with a big-A and another one, with a little-A but they're not like, replicated then you would say two, two-N? <U WHO="S1"> mhm </U> but what if it's replicated and you'd be like, a replicated one with As and a replicated with little-As. </U> <U WHO="S1"> then it's still two-N. </U> <U WHO="S2"> it's still two-N? </U> <U WHO="S1"> yeah okay what's the ploidy of this cell? <EVENT DUR=":16" DESC="PAUSE WHILE WRITING"/> </U> <U WHO="SS"> three-N equals </U> <U WHO="S1"> i knew you'd say that. <U WHO="SU-f"> it's wrong? </U> it's just two-N right? there's two of each kind of chromosome. sure there's three different kinds, <U WHO="SU-f"> oh </U> okay? but there's two of each. okay so don't, get that confused. this would be two-N equals what? </U> <U WHO="SS"> <OVERLAP> six </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> six </OVERLAP> okay? so, ploidy, the N, means, number, of different, chromosomes. if there's one of each, different chromosome, it would be haploid. okay? if there's two of each, different, chromosomes it would be diploid. triploid i'd have to have three of each. and you don't wanna see that. that only happens in plants. usually, and, they live to tell about it. mkay... mkay?

</U> <U WHO="S1"> yeah, yeah. if you don't have pyruvate, or succinate which is a pyruvate substitute then you can't go through respiration so this tube could do nothing. <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"/> okay and the only other thing you have to worry about is succinate, succinate plus whole homogenate, any glycolysis? </U> <U WHO="SS"> no. </U> <U WHO="S1"> why? </U> <U WHO="SS"> because there's no glucose </U> <U WHO="S1"> no glucose, any respiration? </U> <U WHO="SS"> yes. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay. okay succinate, plus supernatant. glycolysis? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> yes, </U> <U WHO="SS"> no. </U> <U WHO="S1"> why not? </U> <U WHO="S5"> cuz there's still no glucose right? </U> <U WHO="S1"> no glucose, respiration? </U> <U WHO="SS"> no </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> no, no mitochondria. </U> <U WHO="S1"> no mitochondria, okay so, nothing there. and lastly, succinate, plus pellet. glycolysis? </U> <U WHO="SS"> no </U> <U WHO="S1"> no. respiration? </U> <U WHO="SS"> yes. </U> <U WHO="S1"> yes. <EVENT DESC="WRITING ON BOARD"/> okay. so if you can keep that straight, i think you're, </U> <U WHO="S5"> you said pyruvate is a, glucose, substitute? </U> <U WHO="S1"> pyruvate. wait i'm sorry? </U> <U WHO="S5"> what is pyruvate, a substitute for? </U> <U WHO="S1"> succinate, is a pyruvate substitute. <U WHO="S5"> okay. </U> okay? glucose is broken down into pyruvate, which feeds directly into the Krebs cycle for respiration. okay? s- but you could substitute anything in the Krebs cycle for pyruvate, and it would work. okay? good? </U> <U WHO="S5"> mhm. </U> <PAUSE DUR=":07"/> <U WHO="S1"> alright? you're good with everything you're ready, bring it on, </U> <U WHO="SS"> no </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> no, the experiments </U> <U WHO="S11"> oh no. </U> <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="LAUGH"/> <U WHO="SU-f"> i told you. </U> <U WHO="S11"> let's have a summary of all of 'em. </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> no </U> <PAUSE DUR=":05"/> <U WHO="S1"> okay, um, experiments, anything specific? </U> <U WHO="S4"> Griffith's was the S-cells and the R-cells. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay <U WHO="S11"> <OVERLAP> that's the rats? </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> you inject the mouse </OVERLAP> hm? </U> <U WHO="S11"> the rats right? <U WHO="S1"> yeah </U> mouse whatever. </U> <U WHO="S1"> you inject the mouse with <U WHO="SS"> S-cells </U> S what happens? </U> <U WHO="SS"> they die </U> <U WHO="S1"> why? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> cuz they had pathogenic </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> they had a capsule around it </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay. cont- contracts pneumonia and dies. <U WHO="SU-f"> basically. </U> okay? mouse plus R-cell does it have a capsule? </U> <U WHO="SS"> <OVERLAP> no. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> no. </OVERLAP> is it virulent does it cause pneumonia? </U> <U WHO="SS"> no </U> <U WHO="S1"> no. does the mouse die with it? </U> <U WHO="SS"> <OVERLAP> no, </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> no. </OVERLAP> heat killed S. what's heat killing do to the S-stain? </U> <U WHO="SS"> breaks up the capsules </U> <U WHO="S1"> breaks open the cap- breaks up the capsule basically destroys the cell wall so it's just naked D-N-A, in solution. and what happens to the mouse? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> it lives. </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay it lives nothing's wrong with it. so alone, live R didn't kill the mouse. alone, heat-killed S doesn't kill the mouse, why does a combination of the two kill the mouse? </U> <U WHO="SS"> cuz transformation </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay transformation occurs and what di- what's being transformed to what? </U> <U WHO="SS"> the S and R </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> R is transferring to S </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay, so, basically, something from the S is getting into R, transforming it to becoming S, and killing the mouse. did they conclude anything more than that? </U> <U WHO="SS"> no. </U> <U WHO="S1"> no. okay? and then it took Avery, what'd Avery do? to a purified solution? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> he took the chemicals <OVERLAP> from that and made them </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S5"> <OVERLAP> killed the mouse </OVERLAP> and killed the D-N-A </U> <U WHO="S1"> okay you take D-N-ase, mkay that kills D-N-A. and if D-N-ase wipes out the D-N-A do you see transformation occurring? </U> <U WHO="SS"> no </U> <U WHO="S1"> no. what about protease that kills the protein? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> it still transforms </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay. still transforms, and therefore what did, Avery conclude? </U> <U WHO="SU-f"> the D-N-A was the uh, </U> <U WHO="SS"> transforming agent </U> <U WHO="S1"> mkay, D-N-A is the transforming principle and not protein. and, protein's so much more complex. there're twenty amino acids there're various ways, millions of ways to hook 'em up. so it was disputed, pretty heavily, debated that uh, D-N-A which is much more simple could be, that important for the genetic material. okay. okay?
