(one hundred and thirteen) that's in the that's from the book yeah. </U> <U WHO="S3"> that's from the book... </U> <U WHO="S2"> is that just to heat stuff up in? </U> <U WHO="S3"> yeah basically i mean i- remember it had to be really really big? because we had to add all the solids? </U> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> i don't know </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S4"> <OVERLAP> yeah it wasn't </OVERLAP> too much bigger, maybe fifteen hundred, <OVERLAP> gallons or something. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> oh, </OVERLAP> yeah that's true. </U> <U WHO="S1"> well what all did it include i mean like, <OVERLAP> d- do we need all those? </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> it has the agitator, </OVERLAP> it has all the, <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> thermal </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> electrical </OVERLAP> and, thermometer stuff. </U> <U WHO="S3"> here i'll look at the book. <PAUSE DUR=":06"/> see i was responsible (too and) brought my book, <EVENT WHO="S1" DESC="LAUGH"/> (seven thirty-one.) </U> <U WHO="S1"> hmm, ooh, we still need water purification. </U> <U WHO="S3"> Brita </U> <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"/> <U WHO="S1"> but we can't even, i mean, <U WHO="S3"> <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> <OVERLAP> includes, </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> we can't even find a pro </OVERLAP> price for Brita. </U> <U WHO="S3"> kettle jacket agitator thermometer well, drive and support man hole cover stuff in box, and clamps. install costs includes above installation costs, <OVERLAP> uh. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> what are </OVERLAP> clamps? </U> <U WHO="S3"> i guess to clamp it down? </U> <U WHO="S1"> (do we need) cast iron jacketed_is... </U> <U WHO="S3"> yeah would we need a, cuz <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> probably service (xx) </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> cuz we did_ we used this line </OVERLAP> the stainless steel line. what was this stuff? </U> <U WHO="S1"> we just chose the stainless steel? </U> <U WHO="S2"> mhm. </U> <U WHO="S1"> agitator (xx) </U> <U WHO="S2"> wi- oh that makes it <OVERLAP> more expensive. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> cuz we, </OVERLAP> we haven't looked into materials at all. i mean we've said stainless <OVERLAP> steel, </OVERLAP> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> stainless steel every time </OVERLAP> </U> but, i don't know i just wonder <OVERLAP> (with him) </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> mm </OVERLAP> that makes the price go down, a little bit. </U> <U WHO="S3"> what about, <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> what about, adding </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> what's </OVERLAP> this crap? if we use, this is um, (wait) pounds per square inch that's like a force, that we can apply. <OVERLAP> we don't </OVERLAP> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> pressure </OVERLAP> </U> yeah we don't need that much pressure inside the kettle do we? </U> <U WHO="S1"> i have no clue. </U> <U WHO="S3"> so that would bring our cost down to only about... well, a quarter, halfway between here and here. </U> <U WHO="S1"> well what did we choose at first? what pressure? </U> <U WHO="S3"> well we didn't even take pressure into consideration we we- we went up here, <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> to, materials </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> and took like </OVERLAP> an average one. </U> <U WHO="S1"> well let's figure out pressure. i, i've been thinking about pressure all week (especially,) thinking that, he's gonna be like, what about pressure? <OVERLAP> you guys are just talking about temperature. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> but how are we gonna know? </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S3"> but </U> <U WHO="S4"> i don't think that, it's a big deal cuz if you can, do like these little home breweries in a five gallon bucket and you know, <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> yeah, that's true </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> you don't, you're not worrying about </OVERLAP> pressure, too much with <OVERLAP> that, something like that. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S3"> <OVERLAP> has anything mentioned, </OVERLAP> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> that's true, that's true. </OVERLAP> </U> pressure in any of our process things? </U> <U WHO="S2"> i don't think so. </U> <U WHO="S1"> i don't think so. </U> <U WHO="S3"> it's so- it's been, <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> i don't remember anything about pressures. </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> i think if we, like </OVERLAP> on the flow diagram draw the temperature, at every single stage what's the temperature inside <OVERLAP> find out the </OVERLAP> temperature in the fermenter, <U WHO="S4"> mhm </U> temperature is, a big deal. i know it's a big deal (so.) </U> <U WHO="S1"> we also have different temperatures like when you're um, when you're doing the_ well that was for the fermenter, never mind... i don't_ but what about when you're mashing i think you, i think you go like to one temperature and then you raise it up to the next. has to do with the enzymes. i don't know let me get out my <OVERLAP> notebook. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S3"> <OVERLAP> i thought </OVERLAP> you wanted to keep it pretty high to kill the enzymes. </U> <U WHO="S1"> yeah, but when you do w- when you're worrying about, fermentation, you actually go, like you stay at one temperature for a while to activate, one enzyme and then, raise it up to activate another. and then you like_ i don't know leave it in between i think_ w- i don't know i'll have to wait (till) </U> <U WHO="S2"> is that, is that the same even for the cold contact method? </U> <U WHO="S1"> yeah see i don't even think, we'd hafta worry about it if we do it, that way you know...? cuz what do you hafta wo- why do you hafta worry about enzymes that, you're not even gonna ferment. </U> <U WHO="S2"> you're not even gonna make, alcohol. </U> <U WHO="S3"> what's fifty times ten-to-the-fourth? ten-to-the-fourth is, </U> <U WHO="S4"> fifty thousand. </U> <U WHO="S3"> okay fifty thousand why don't you, bump that <OVERLAP> kettle down </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S4"> <OVERLAP> that 's fine </OVERLAP> fifty, fifty times ten-to-the-fourth, <U WHO="S3"> <OVERLAP> yeah </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> yeah </OVERLAP> that's right yeah. </U> <U WHO="S2"> fifty thousand </U> <U WHO="S3"> no cuz five times <U WHO="S4"> <OVERLAP> it's five hundred thousand. </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> ten-to-the-fourth </OVERLAP> it's five hundred thousand. </U> <U WHO="S4"> for for a what? </U> <U WHO="S1"> no fifty <U WHO="S3"> <OVERLAP> well i'm </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> times- </OVERLAP> ten-to-the-fourth, </U> <U WHO="S2"> fifty times ten-to-the-fourth? </U> <U WHO="S4"> ten-to-the-fourth is ten thousand though yeah <OVERLAP> it's five hundred thousand. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> it's five hundred thousand </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S3"> right it's <U WHO="S1"> <OVERLAP> five hundred thousand </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> five hundred thousand </OVERLAP> i'm looking at, this different, <EVENT WHO="S2" DESC="LAUGH"/> <U WHO="S1"> engineers in action </U> <U WHO="S4"> <OVERLAP> what is, what is it? </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> i'm looking at this different, </OVERLAP> graph <OVERLAP> for the kettle. </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> this is high </OVERLAP> did you guys, <U WHO="S3"> and i guess, </U> did you say this one was, did you write down something different? </U> <U WHO="S3"> well, this one we put about, yeah it was about a hundred thousand dollars, and then we scaled it up cuz this was in nineteen ninety, so we scaled it up for ninety, t- <OVERLAP> for like, </OVERLAP> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> oh </OVERLAP> </U> present, </U> <U WHO="S2"> but you did have it at a hundred thousand <OVERLAP> though? </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S3"> <OVERLAP> at a </OVERLAP> hundred thousand, according to this but if i go <OVERLAP> according to this, </OVERLAP> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> oh we were like up here? </OVERLAP> </U> no. </U> <U WHO="S2"> oh great. </U> <U WHO="S4"> can i see it? </U> <U WHO="S2"> is this <OVERLAP> too low? </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S3"> <OVERLAP> ten-to-the-fifth </OVERLAP> is a hundred thousand right? </U> <U WHO="S4"> yeah </U> <U WHO="S3"> so, it would be half that, that would be fifty thousand. </U> <U WHO="S1"> fifty thousand sounds more reasonable. </U> <U WHO="S3"> yeah </U> <U WHO="S2"> yeah if i, i don't think </U> <U WHO="S4"> <OVERLAP> did i, did i give the wrong number, when i was looking at this? </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S3"> <OVERLAP> cuz look at, look at this, </OVERLAP> no you, <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> well i, i don't know </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> you said it fine </OVERLAP> i'm, just look at this graph, <U WHO="S4"> okay </U> and there's like four different lines for stainless steel, <U WHO="S4"> right </U> with different pressures inside of 'em, use the lowest pressure one and then what, <OVERLAP> what do you get out? </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> what do you get? </OVERLAP> </U> <U WHO="S1"> Uncle Joe gave us fifty <U WHO="S3"> <OVERLAP> for dollars </OVERLAP> </U> <OVERLAP> thousand bucks </OVERLAP> and we're gonna spend <U WHO="S2"> <OVERLAP> we're gonna </OVERLAP> <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> </U> <OVERLAP> five hundred </OVERLAP> on a, tank. <EVENT DESC="LAUGH"/> </U> <U WHO="S4"> how big do we <OVERLAP> want it?
